<p>This document will explain how to do total copy-number analysis on
GenomeWideSNP_6 (aka &quot;6.0&quot;, &quot;SNP6&quot; and &quot;GWS6&quot;) data.  Although we will
use 6.0 data in the example, the exact same code can be used for
GenomeWideSNP_5 (aka &quot;5.0&quot;, &quot;SNP5&quot; and &quot;GWS5&quot;) data.  The only
difference is what annotation files are used.</p>

<p>We will go through how to setup the data set, calibrate it for allelic
crosstalk, then summarize the probe data in order to obtain so called
chip effects, which we then normalize for PCR fragment-length effects as
well as for imbalances in <em>Nsp</em>I and <em>Sty</em>I mixes.
The normalize chip
effects are then passed to the Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS)
methods, which identifies aberrant regions in the genome.  The results
will be browsable in the ChromosomeExplorer (see Figure above).</p>

<p>A small disclaimer: The outlined method is not final and is under
development.  Especially note that we no longer have a multichip
probe-level model that protects us against outliers.  Instead such
outliers has to be dealt with by the segmentation method.  However, we
find it good enough at this stage in order for us to share it.</p>

<h3>Verifying annotation data files</h3>

<p>Affymetrix provides two different CDF files for the GenomeWideSNP_6
chip type, namely the &quot;default&quot; and &quot;full&quot; CDF.  The full CDF contains
what the default one does plus more.  We are always using the full CDF.
We start by locating this CDF:</p>

<pre><code class="r">cdf &lt;- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType(&quot;GenomeWideSNP_6&quot;, tags=&quot;Full&quot;)
print(cdf)
</code></pre>

<p>gives</p>

<pre><code>AffymetrixCdfFile:

<p>Before we continue, the following will assert that the UFL and the UGP
annotation files can be found and that they are compatible with the give
CDF.  These step are not really needed for analysis, because they are
done in the background, but it is a good test to see that the setup is
correct and catch any errors in setup already here.</p>

<p>Note how the chip type of the CEL set indicates that the full CDF is in use.</p>

<h3>Calibration for allelic crosstalk</h3>

<p>The first thing we will do is calibrate the probe signals such that
offset in and crosstalk between alleles in the SNPs is removed.  Offset
is also removed from the CN probes.  Finally, the probe signals are
rescaled such that all probes not on ChrX and ChrY all have the same
average for all arrays (=2200).  Allelic crosstalk calibration is a
single-array method, that is, each array is calibrated independently of
the others.  This means that you can use this method to calibrate a
single array and having more arrays will not make different.</p>

<pre><code class="r">acc &lt;- AllelicCrosstalkCalibration(cs)
print(acc)
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code>AllelicCrosstalkCalibration:  
Data set: HapMap270  
Input tags: 6.0,CEU,testSet  
Output tags: 6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY  
Number of arrays: 6 (395.13MB)  
Chip type: GenomeWideSNP_6,Full  
Algorithm parameters: (rescaleBy: chr &quot;all&quot;, targetAvg: num 2200,
subsetToAvg: chr &quot;-XY&quot;, alpha: num [1:5] 0.1 0.075 0.05 0.03 0.01, q:
num 2, Q: num 98)  
Output path:
probeData/HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY/GenomeWideSNP_6  
Is done: FALSE
RAM: 0.00MB
</code></pre>

<p>First of all, it is important to understand that the above code <em>does
not</em> calibrate the data set, but instead it sets up the method for doing
so.  We will do that in the next step.  But first note how tags
&#39;ACC,ra,-XY&#39; are appended to the data set name.  The &#39;ACC&#39; tag indicates
Allelic-Crosstalk Calibration, the &#39;ra&#39; tags indicates that afterward
all values are rescaled together (&quot;rescale all&quot;), and the tag &#39;-XY&#39;
indicates that units on ChrX &amp; ChrY are excluded from the <em>model fit</em>
(estimate of the calibration parameters).  This is the default behavior
and is done in order to avoid XX and XY samples being artificially shrunk
toward each other.  However, note that <em>all units are still calibrated.</em></p>

<p>To calibrate the probe signals, do:</p>

<pre><code class="r">csC &lt;- process(acc, verbose=verbose)
print(csC)
</code></pre>

<p>which after a while will give:</p>

<pre><code>AffymetrixCelSet:
Name: HapMap270
Tags: 6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY
Path: probeData/HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY/GenomeWideSNP_6

Number of arrays: 6
Names: NA06985, NA06991, ..., NA07019
Time period: 2007-12-09 02:32:49 -- 2007-12-09 02:54:05
Total file size: 394.42MB
RAM: 0.01MB
</code></pre>

<p>This takes approximately 1.5-2 mins per array.</p>

<p><em>Comment</em>: If you are processing 6.0 arrays, it is likely that the
original CEL files are in the new AGCC/Calvin file format.  Since
aroma.affymetrix can currently only read such files but not write them,
the calibrated/normalized data is stored as binary/XDA CEL file.
Because of this &quot;conversion&quot;, the creation of the CEL files will take
some time.  Downstream analysis will then all be done using binary/XDA
CEL files, and the above slowdown will not be observed.</p>

<h3>Summarization</h3>

<p>For the SNP &amp; CN chip types all probes are technical replicates, why it
makes little sense to model probe affinities (because all probes within
a probeset should have identical affinities).  Without probe affinities,
the model basically becomes a single-array model.  Thus, probe-level
summarization for these newer chip types is effectively done for each array
independently (although the implementation processing the data
in multi-chip fashion).  For total copy number analysis ignoring strand
information, probe signals for SNPs are averaged across replicates and
summarized between alleles, and probe signals for CN probes, which are
all single-probe units, are left as it.  Since some probe signals might
become negative (by chance) from the allelic crosstalk calibration
and due to random errors around zero, we offset of probe signals 300
units.  This model is set up as:</p>

<pre><code class="r">plm &lt;- AvgCnPlm(csC, mergeStrands=TRUE, combineAlleles=TRUE, shift=+300)
print(plm)
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code>AvgCnPlm:
Data set: HapMap270
Chip type: GenomeWideSNP_6,Full
Input tags: 6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY
Output tags: 6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY,AVG,+300,A+B
Parameters: (probeModel: chr &quot;pm&quot;; shift: num 300; flavor: chr &quot;median&quot;
mergeStrands: logi TRUE; combineAlleles: logi TRUE).
Path:
plmData/HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY,AVG,+300,A+B/GenomeWideSNP_6
RAM: 0.00MB
</code></pre>

<p>Note how tags &#39;AVG,+300,A+B&#39; are added.  The first one indicates that an
AvgPlm was used, &#39;+300&#39; that the input data was shifted (translated)
+300 before being fitted, and &#39;A+B&#39; indicates that allele A and allele B
probe pairs are summed together before being fitted, i.e.
PM=PM_A+PM_B, since <code>combineAlleles=TRUE</code>.</p>

<p>By the way, all the SNPs in the GWS6 chip type only holds probes from
one of the two strands, which means that the argument <code>mergeStrands</code> has
no effect but it adds a tag indicating what value was used.  The same
holds for GWS5.</p>

<p>As with cross-talk calibration, no data is yet processed.  In order fit
the PLM defined above, we call:</p>

<pre><code class="r">if (length(findUnitsTodo(plm)) &gt; 0) {
    # Fit CN probes quickly (\~5-10s/array + some overhead)
   units &lt;- fitCnProbes(plm, verbose=verbose)
   str(units)
   # int [1:945826] 935590 935591 935592 935593 935594 935595 ...

  # Fit remaining units, i.e. SNPs (\~5-10min/array)
   units &lt;- fit(plm, verbose=verbose)
   str(units)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will take some time!  Moreover, if it is the first time you process
a given chip type, then a so called &quot;monocell&quot; CDF needs to be created,
which in turn takes quite some time.  When you later process data for
the same chip type, the monocell CDF is already available (it is saved
in the annotationData/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/ directory).</p>

<p><strong>A note on non-positive signals and NaN estimates</strong>:  Whenever
calibrating  for allelic crosstalk, one obtains some non-positive
signals.  Indeed, with 50% homozygote (AA and BB) SNPs, and if you
assume symmetric noise, then actually half of the calibrated homozygote
probe signals will be below zero and half above zero, i.e. for genotype
AA there are 50% negative allele B signals and vice versa for genotype
BB.  Thus, 25% of your probe allele signals for SNPs may be non-positive
if the crosstalk calibration is &quot;perfect&quot;.  For total copy number
analysis we can add the allele A and allele B signals such that we
partly avoid this problem.  However, there will still be some
signals there are zero or negative although they are summed.  When
fitting the log additive model, these values will become <code>NaN</code> when taking
the logarithm, which is why you will see warnings on:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;In log(y, base=2) : NaNs produced&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>These warnings are expected.  Such data points will be ignored (fitted
with zero weight) when fitting the log-additive model for probe
sets.  However, by chance some probesets will have all missing values
because of this and therefore the estimated chip effects will also be
NaN.  To lower the risk for this we can add some offset back, which is
what the <code>shift=+300</code> does.  For a further discussion on non-positive
values, see <a name=cite-BengtssonH_etal_2009-CRMAv1></a><a href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;amp;retmode=ref&amp;amp;id=18204055">Bengtsson, Irizarry, Carvalho, and Speed (2008)</a>.</p>

<p>When fitting a probe-level model, one set of estimates are the chip
effects, which we later will use to estimate raw copy numbers.  You can
get the chip-effect set and see where they are stored etc. by calling:</p>

<pre><code class="r">ces &lt;- getChipEffectSet(plm)
print(ces)

</code></pre>

<p>Here we see that the chip type has now got the tag &#39;monocell&#39; appended.
This indicates that the chip-effect set is a special type of CEL set.
The CEL files do not have the structure of the initial CDF
(GenomeWideSNP_6,Full), but instead the structure of a monocell CDF,
which is &quot;miniature&quot; of the initial CDF.</p>

<p>Final note, in the current implementation the CN probe units are treated
as any other unit, although the probe summarization equals the probe
intensity, which could be used to speed up the processing.  We hope to
improve the implementation in a future release resulting in a much
faster processing of CN probes (basically instant).</p>

<h3>PCR fragment length normalization</h3>

<p>The probe-level summaries are currently structured and stored as if they
were chip effects in a multi-chip PLM, which is why we still call them
&quot;chip effects&quot;.  When preparing the target DNA, the DNA is digested and
amplified in two parallel tracks using two different enzymes, namely
NspI and StyI.  This means that the units (SNPs and the CN probes)
may be digested by either enzyme exclusively or both enzymes.  The
result are one or two fragments of different lengths per unit.  When
doing PCR, fragments of different lengths are amplified differently.
Even more important, this systematic effect varies slightly from sample
to sample.  We have created a specific multi-chip model that controls
for systematic effects across samples as a function of fragment lengths
and enzyme mixtures.  This model also controls for imbalances in NspI
and StyI mixes.  Details on the model will be published later.</p>

<p>Note that this normalization method is a multi-chip method.  It estimate
baseline (target) effects as the effects observed in a robust average
across all arrays.  Then each array is normalized such that it has the
same effect as the baseline effect.  Effectively, this approach will
make systematic effects <em>across arrays</em> to cancel out.  Having more
arrays, will provide a more stable estimate of the baseline effect.
Processing a single array will make no difference.  Theoretically it
should be possible to process as few as two arrays, but we have not
studies of how well this works (overfitting etc).</p>

<p>To use the above model, do:</p>

<pre><code class="r">fln &lt;- FragmentLengthNormalization(ces)

fragment-length normalized excluding ChrX &amp; ChrY from the model
fit.  <em>All units (that have fragment-length information) are still
calibrated</em>.</p>

<p>As before, the above is just a setup of a method.  To actually normalize
the chip effects, we do:</p>

<p>Fragment-length normalization takes approximately 1 min/array.</p>

<h2>Identification of copy-number regions (CNRs)</h2>

<p>To run segmentation on raw CN estimates (log2 ratios) you can either use
raw CNs calculated from case-control pairs of samples, or from
samples relative to a common reference.  In order to do paired analysis
using the Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) method, do:</p>

<pre><code class="r">cbs &lt;- CbsModel(ces1, ces2)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>ces1</code> is a CEL set of test samples and <code>ces2</code> is a CEL set of the
same number of control samples.  Use <code>ces1 &lt;- cesN[arrays1]</code> and same for
<code>ces2</code> to extract the two sets from the <code>cesN</code> CEL set above.</p>

<pre><code>
Here we will focus on the non-paired case, where the common reference is
by default calculated as the robust average across samples.  To setup
the CBS model is this way, do:
```r
cbs &lt;- CbsModel(cesN)
print(cbs)
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code>CbsModel:

<p>The above tells us many things.  First, we see that the output data is
stored in a subdirectory of cbsData/.  We see that there is only one
chip type involved (for the 500K chip set, we would have two chip types
merged in the segmentation).  We see that the chip-effect set used is
the one we got from fragment-length normalization.  There is no
reference set specified, so the reference for each sample defaults to
the (robust) average across all samples.</p>

<h3>Extracting raw copy numbers (optional)</h3>

<p><em>This subsection is optional and may be skipped.</em>
Given any CopyNumberChromosomalModel, including GladModel, it is possible to
extract raw copy numbers (log-ratios as defined in <a href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;amp;retmode=ref&amp;amp;id=18204055">Bengtsson, Irizarry, Carvalho, et al. (2008)</a> as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rawCNs &lt;- extractRawCopyNumbers(cbs, array=1, chromosome=1)
print(rawCNs)

## RawCopyNumbers:
## Number of loci: 40203
## Loci fields: cn [40203xnumeric], x [40203xnumeric]
## RAM: 0.61MB
</code></pre>

<p>This object holds (in memory) the raw CN estimates (<code>cn</code>) and their
genomic locations (<code>x</code>) on the requested chromosome.  The easiest way to
work with this data is to turn it into a data frame:</p>

<pre><code class="r">rawCNs &lt;- as.data.frame(rawCNs)
str(rawCNs)

## &#39;data.frame&#39;:   40203 obs. of  2 variables:
## $ x : num  742429 767376 769185 775852 782343 ...
## $ cn: num  -0.613 -0.715 -0.127 -0.349 -0.201 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this can be done before/without fitting the copy-number
model.  Moreover, the raw CNs are estimates the exact same way
regardless of CN model (GladModel, CbsModel, ...).</p>

<h3>Fitting copy-number model and displaying results</h3>

<p>We are next going to display the raw CNs and the segmentation results in
the ChromosomeExplorer.  As we will see, when asking the explorer to
process a certain array and chromosome, it will in turn ask the
segmentation model to fit that same data, if not already fitted.  So, we
take the following shortcut.</p>

<p>To fit CBS and at the same time generate graphical output for, say,
chromosome 19, 22, and 23 (X), do:</p>

<pre><code class="r">ce &lt;- ChromosomeExplorer(cbs)
print(ce)
</code></pre>

<p>which gives:</p>

<pre><code>ChromosomeExplorer:
Name: HapMap270
Tags: 6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY,AVG,+300,A+B,FLN,-XY
Number of arrays: 6
Path:
reports/HapMap270/6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY,AVG,+300,A+B,FLN,-XY/GenomeWideSNP_6/cbs
RAM: 0.00MB
</code></pre>

<p>We see that the output will be stored under the reports/ directory.
Note the slightly different layout of subdirectories compared with what
we otherwise see.  The first subdirectory is named after the data set
<em>without tags.</em>  Instead the tags alone specify the next level of
subdirectory.  This is done in order to collect reports for the same
data set in the same directory tree.</p>

<p>To start fitting the segmentation model, generating plots and the
explorer report, we do:</p>

<pre><code class="r">process(ce, chromosomes=c(19, 22, 23), verbose=verbose)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, although CBS is currently the fastest segmentation available
in aroma.affymetrix, these new chip type have so many markers per
chromosome that the processing time will be substantial.  The
segmentation is currently what takes most of the time in CN analysis.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to view the ChromosomeExplorer, do:</p>

<pre><code class="r">display(ce)
</code></pre>

<p>which will launch your browser. You can also open the report manually by loading
&#39;reports/HapMap270/6.0,CEU,testSet,ACC,ra,-XY,AVG,+300,A+B,FLN,-XY/ChromosomeExplorer.html&#39; in the browser.</p>

<p>If for some reason we wanted to perform segmentation without displaying
the results, we could have called:</p>

<pre><code class="r">fit(cbs, chromosomes=c(19, 22, 23), verbose=verbose)
</code></pre>

<p>to do segmentation on Chr19, Chr22 and ChrX.  The estimated copy-number
regions will be  stored in files under cbsData/.   If we then decide we
wish to display the results, we can use the code above to do so (create
ChromosomeExplorer object, process and display).</p>

<p>There may be cases in which only a subset of arrays is desired.  In such
instances we can use the arrays argument of <code>process()</code> or <code>fit()</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code class="r">process(ce, arrays=1:2, chromosomes=c(19, 22, 23), verbose=verbose)
fit(cbs, arrays=1:2, chromosomes=c(19, 22, 23), verbose=verbose)
</code></pre>
