<h1>The Aroma Framework: How data files and data sets are located</h1>

<p>Author: Henrik Bengtsson<br>

<p>This document gives detailed information on how the aroma framework
locates data files and data sets.  It also shows how to best share data
on as hared file system between users.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" style="font-size: 1.2em;"></span>
In order to utilize <em>sibling root directories</em> (easy sharing of
read-only files among users on the same file system) it is necessary to
do 'setOption(aromaSettings, "devel/dropRootPathTags", TRUE)'.
Future releases will make this the default.
</div>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>FULLNAME, NAME AND TAGS:</strong></p>

<p>A <strong>fullname</strong> consists of a <strong>name</strong> and optional comma-separated
<strong>tags</strong>, e.g. the fullname &#39;HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet&#39; has name
&#39;HapMap270&#39; and tags &#39;6.0,CEU,testSet&#39;.  By this convention, neither
names nor tags can themselves contain commas.</p>

<p>The default in the aroma framework is that fullnames (and therefore
names and tags) are inferred from the filename of a file, or the data
set directory name.  For instance, a raw CEL file with filename
&#39;NA06985,XX.CEL&#39; hasfullname &#39;NA06985,XX&#39; with name &#39;NA06985&#39; and the
single tag &#39;XX&#39;.  It&#39;s file extension is *.CEL.  This file may be part
of raw data set &#39;HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet&#39; (fullname) with name
&#39;HapMap270&#39; and the three tags &#39;6.0&#39;, &#39;CEU&#39;, and &#39;testSet&#39; (short
&#39;6.0,CEU,testSet&#39;).</p>

<p><strong>THE CURRENT DIRECTORY:</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>current directory</strong>, aka the working directory, is the
directory given by <code>getwd()</code>.  This is often the directory in which R and
aroma was started.</p>

<p><strong>ROOT DIRECTORIES:</strong></p>

<p>A <strong>root directory</strong> is a aroma-specific directory that is available
in the current directory and in turn contains subdirectories.  Root
directories can be recognized by their names ending with *Data/, e.g.
annotationData/ and rawData/.</p>

<p>A <strong>main root directory</strong> is a root directory whose fullname has no
tags.  Whenever aroma writes results to file, it always does so under a
main root directory, which is why there also must be sufficient write
permissions in addition to read permissions.</p>

<p>A <strong>sibling root directory</strong> is a root directory whose fullname contains
tags (Footnote #1), e.g. annotationData,shared/ and rawData,shared/.
 Whenever aroma is locating a data file or a data set, it always
searches the main root directory before the sibling root directories.</p>

<p>Sibling root directories are useful for sharing data sets and data files
in common location on the file system without having to give everyone
write permissions to it.  A sibling root directory is typically setup as
a file-system link (as all root directories always in the current
directory) pointing to a location elsewhere on the file system.  Using
sibling root directories this way saves overall disk space, minimizes
redundancy, further simplifies structuring of data files, and, in
support for reproducible research, minimizes the amount of reprocessing
required by a group of users interested in the same data sets.</p>

<p>The aroma framework will <em>never</em> write to a sibling root directory
(Footnote #2), which also means that it is sufficient that there are
read permissions.  Indeed, we suggest that write permissions are not
shared for sibling root directories.  Although main root directories in
theory could be shared, they should always be treated as if they are
private to the user.  This minimizes the risk for race conditions where
two users try to write to or update the same file at the same time
(Footnote #3).</p>

<h2>Annotation data</h2>

<p>Whenever aroma needs to locate an annotation data file, it always
searches the main root directory annotationData/ first.  If the file
cannot be found there, it will then search any available sibling root
directories in (lexicographic) order, e.g. annotationData,lab/ and
annotationData,shared/.  If it fails to locate a file, it is often the
case that an exception is thrown and the analysis is interrupted with an
informative error message.</p>

<p>Annotation data files are identified by their type, their chip types and
optionally by additional tags.  The type is implicit from the class or
method used, whereas the name and the tags are commonly arguments
specified by the user, although in some cases also those are inferred
indirectly.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<pre><code class="r"># Explicit set up annotation data file
cdf &lt;- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType(&quot;GenomeWideSNP_6&quot;, tags=&quot;Full&quot;)
ugp &lt;- AromaUgpFile$byChipType(&quot;GenomeWideSNP_6&quot;, tags=&quot;Full&quot;)

# Implicit set up annotation data file, where the type is
# inferred by the method name and the name and the tags are
# inferred from the input object.
ugp &lt;- getAromaUgpFile(cdf)
</code></pre>

<p>In the first case, aroma searches for an Affymetrix CDF file located in
annotationData<em>/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/,where annotationData</em>/
means that it first searches main root directory annotationData/ and
then any sibling directories annotationData,&lt;tags&gt;/.  In the second
case, aroma searches for an Aroma UGP file located in
annotationData<em>/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/.  In the third case, aroma
also searches for an Aroma UGP file located in
annotationData</em>/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/, where the chip type is
inferred from the CDF via getChipType(cdf).</p>

<p>The convention in the aroma framework is that whenever annotation
data files are created, they are written to the main root directory,
that is, under annotationData/,
e.g. annotationData/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,monocell.CDF.
 It will never write to a sibling root directory (Footnote #2).</p>

<h2>Raw data sets</h2>

<p>Whenever aroma tries to locate a raw data set, it always searches the
main root directory rawData/ first, and, if not found there, then any
available sibling root directories, e.g. rawData,shared/.</p>

<p>Data sets are located by their type, their names and optional tags, and
their chip types.  The type is implicit from the class, whereas the name
and the tags as well as the chip type are commonly specified explicitly
via arguments, although in some cases also those are also inferred
indirectly.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<pre><code class="r"># Explicit specification of name, tags and chip type
csR &lt;- AffymetrixCelSet$byName(&quot;HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet&quot;,
chipType=&quot;GenomeWideSNP_6,Full&quot;)

# Implicit specification of chip type (via the CDF)
csR &lt;- AffymetrixCelSet$byName(&quot;HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet&quot;, cdf=cdf)
</code></pre>

<p>In both these cases, aroma searches for Affymetrix CEL files located in
rawData<em>/HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet/GenomeWideSNP_6/, where rawData</em>/
means that it first searches main root directory rawData/ and then any
sibling directories rawData,&lt;tags&gt;/.</p>

<h2>Intermediate and final data sets</h2>

<p><strong><em>Currently sibling root directories are not supported for intermediate
and final data sets and data files.</em></strong>  This means that all such data
needs to be located under main root directories, e.g. probeData/,
plmData/ etc.  Following the aroma-framework convention above, all
intermediate and final data sets and data files are stored under a main
root directories.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>

<pre><code class="r"># Assume that the following raw data set is located in
# rawData,shared/HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet/GenomeWideSNP_6/
csR &lt;- AffymetrixCelSet$byName(&quot;HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet&quot;,
chipType=&quot;GenomeWideSNP_6,Full&quot;)

# If the average array signals are not available, then they are
# calculated and stored in a single file in
# rawData/HapMap270,6.0,CEU,testSet/GenomeWideSNP_6/
cfR &lt;- getAverageFile(csR)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, if the above two steps are repeated, the data set itself will
still be located under rawData,shared/ (because the new data set
directory under rawData/ is considered to be empty and hence ignored),
and the average file will be located under the main root
directory, although the data set itself is located under a sibling root
directory.  If it is believed that this average file is useful to
others, then, given the correct file privileges, one could move the
average file to the data set directory that contains the raw data.  This
way the same averaging will never have to be calculated again by any
user who links to this data set directory.</p>

<h1>Footnotes</h1>

<p>Footnote #1: Sibling root directories are currently only possible for
annotationData/ and rawData/.</p>

<p>Footnote #2: Currently, there is no protection in aroma against
updating an existing data set/data file that is already located in a
sibling root directory.  This means that it is possible for a user to
setup, for instance, an UGP file located under sibling root directory
annotationData,shared/ and then update it via methods specific to this
class of annotation files.  Protection against such misusage can be
obtained by making sure that the user, and hence the aroma framework,
has no write privileges to sibling root directories.</p>

<p>Footnote #3: The aroma framework creates files <em>atomically</em> by first
writing to a temporary file, which is then renamed.  Writing files
atomically lower the risk for race conditions, but still does not
guarantee that there will not be any conflicts.  For instance, on file
system such as Unix NFS, it may take up to 30 seconds before a newly
created file is visible to all computers on the file system leaving a
short window for such race conditions to take place.</p>
