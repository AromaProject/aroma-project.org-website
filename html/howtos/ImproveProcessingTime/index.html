<h1>How to: Improve processing time</h1>

<p>Author: Henrik Bengtsson<br>
Created on: 2008-11-04<br>
Last updates: 2017-06-10</p>

<p>The time it takes to process a data set can be important, especially
when the data set is large or many alternative methods are explored.
This section covers some parts of the package that affect the processing
time.</p>

<h2>Working towards a local file system is much faster</h2>

<p>Since the package relies heavily on the file system for reading and
writing data and results, the performance of the file system will have a
great impact on the overall processing speed.  We know as a fact that
working with files over a local network (LAN) can substantially slow
down the processing, whereas working toward a local hard drive is much
faster.</p>

<p>User success stories:</p>

<ul>
<li>  User reports 15x improvement: Thread &#39;<a href="https://groups.google.com//group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/6d51a4bb43f1d360#">Running aroma.affymetrix on a
large dataset and time/space
issue</a>&#39;
(2010-01-11).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enable parallel processing</h2>

<p>It is possible to process data in parallel on a local machine or on compute cluster.  To enable <em>parallel processing</em> on the current machine, use <code>future::plan(&quot;multiprocess&quot;)</code>.  For more details, see How to &#39;<a href="../../howtos/parallel_processing/index.html">Process data in parallel</a>&#39;.</p>

<h2>Allow more memory to be used</h2>

<p>As far as possible, the algorithms of the package are designed and
implemented such that they have a bounded-memory usage.  This can often
be achieved by redesigning the algorithm to work with data from only a
few arrays at any time.  However, in some case this is not possible and
instead the data has to be fitted in chunks.  The fitting of multi-array
probe-level models (PLMs), is such an example.  For methods processing
data in chunks, the size of each chunk is by default set so that only
0.5-1.5MB of RAM is used at any time.  When more RAM is available, one
might consider increasing the amount of memory used, by for instance,</p>

<pre><code class="r"># Use 10 times more RAM than the default settings
setOption(aromaSettings, &quot;memory/ram&quot;, 10.0)

plm &lt;- RmaPlm(csN)
fit(plm)
</code></pre>

<p>If argument <code>ram</code> is greater than one, more memory is used than the
default (<code>ram = 1.0</code>), and vice versa for small values.  For more details,
see &#39;<a href="../../settings/index.html">Settings</a>&#39;. Since there in each chunk is some overhead
from reading and especially writing data and results, using larger
chunks will speed up the processing to some extend.  There is a
system-specific upper limit where the payoff is no longer noticeable.</p>

<p>User success stories:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A user with 128 GiB RAM, reports a 5x speedup by using <code>ram = 200</code> while
still only using 4 GiB of RAM.  All in all this user manage to speed
up the processing 65-70 times(!); Thread &#39;<a href="https://groups.google.com//group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/6d51a4bb43f1d360#">Running aroma.affymetrix
on a large dataset and time/space
issue</a>&#39;
(2010-01-11).</li>
<li>  A user with 32 GiB RAM, reports a 30% speedup by using <code>ram = 10</code>: Thread
&#39;<a href="https://groups.google.com//group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/9d36fe1e6efbc22f/af7feba0658242f6">Processing problem with RmaCnPlm() for 338
samples</a>&#39;
(2008-07-07).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fit CN probes separately for PLMs</h2>

<p>For the GenomeWideSNP_5 and GenomeWideSNP_6 chip types, the
non-polymorphic units consists of single CN probes.  Since there is only
one single observation for each of these loci, the only reasonable
&quot;summarization&quot; available is to take the probe signal as the
estimate(*).   Although this approach has been known for a long time, we
still haven&#39;t had time to implement a general and automatic feature for
this.  However, in the meanwhile, we provide an ad hoc method for doing
this manually, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="r">plm &lt;- AvgCnPlm(csN)
if (length(findUnitsTodo(plm)) &gt; 0) fitCnProbes(plm)
fit(plm)
</code></pre>

<p>The method <code>fitCnProbes()</code> is available for all ProbeLevelModel:s and will
copy the probe intensity as is to the corresponding elements and
chip-effect files.  This will take approximately 5-10 seconds per
array.  This will decrease the processing time substantially - for large
data sets with several hours.  The following call to <code>fit()</code> will detect
the already fitted CN units and proceed with the rest.</p>

<p>Footnote: (*) For log-additive models such as RmaPlm, one might want to
set the estimate to <code>NA</code> if the signal is non-positive.  This is currently
not implemented in the above approach, where  instead all values are
copied over as is.</p>

<h2>Avoid using ASCII CDFs</h2>

<p>A CDF in the text/ASCII file format is substantially slower to query
than the same CDF in the binary (XDA or Calvin) file format.  We
strongly recommend that any processing is done use binary CDFs.  In
fact, unless you override the default settings, the package will detect
when you try to use an ASCII CDF and throw an error telling you not to
do so.  An ASCII CDF can easily be converted to the binary/XDA file
format using <code>convertCdf()</code> that is available in the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/affxparser.html">affxparser</a> package.</p>

<p>See also <a href="../../FAQ/index.html">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>So, what is it that takes time?</h2>

<p>In this part we describe some features and behaviors of the package that
affects the processing time.  Much of what is explained here takes place
internally and there are often no options for the user to change the
behavior such that it affects the speed.  We do indeed have specific
ideas how to improve processing time, which requires some design and
implementation changes, cf. Page &#39;<a href="../../features/future/index.html">Future
directions</a>&#39; (contributions appreciated).</p>

<h3>Faster over time via memoization</h3>

<p>For results that are likely to be generated multiple times, either in
the same analysis or over a long period of time, the package caches
those results in files (and sometime in memory) by a process called
&#39;memoization&#39;.   In other words, the package caches computational
expensive results for reuse in the future.   For instance, when querying
the CDF for the cell indices of a subset of units, the second time you
request the same set of units, the result is almost instant, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="r">system.time(cells &lt;- getCellIndices(cdf, units = 1:1000))
##  user  system elapsed  
##  0.68    0.04    0.77

system.time(cells &lt;- getCellIndices(cdf, units = 1:1000))
##  user  system elapsed  
##  0.02    0.01    0.01
</code></pre>

<p>You will find the latter performance even when you restart R.  Many of
the internal methods and function calls are optimized this way,
especially queries and calculations based on annotation data.  The user
do not have to think about it, because it is all taken care of behind
the scenes.</p>

<p>For more information, see &#39;<a href="../../archive/memoization/index.html">Caching of computational expensive tasks
(memoization)</a>&#39;.</p>

<h3>Creation of monocell CDFs</h3>

<p>The very first time you analyze a new chip type, you will find that
certain steps takes a bit longer than others.  A significant example is
when you run a probe-level model (PLM) summarization on this new chip
type, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="r">plm &lt;- RmaPlm(csN)
fit(plm)
</code></pre>

<p>In order to store the probe summaries, a template referred to as a
&#39;monocell CDF&#39; is needed.  If missing, it is automatically generated
from the (main) CDF.  This process can takes several minutes or more.
Since this is done only once, the next time you analyze this chip type,
the monocell CDF will be available momentarily.  The monocell CDF is
saved in the same directory as the main CDF and it is possible to reuse
an existing monocell CDF elsewhere by copying it from one system
to another.</p>
