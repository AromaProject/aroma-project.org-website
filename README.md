aroma.project.org-website
=========================

To build the The [Aroma Project](http://www.aroma-project.org/) website locally, do:
```
make
```
This will build all HTML and other files and place them under `html/`.  The website is such that most pages can be browsed on the local file system as well as via a web server.
