  Abstract                 = {Motivation:
High-resolution copy-number (CN) analysis have in recent years gained much
attention, not only for the purpose of identifying CN aberrations associated with a
certain phenotype but also for identifying CN polymorphisms. In order for such studies
to be successful and cost effective, the statistical methods have to be optimized. We
propose a single-array preprocessing method for estimating full-resolution total CNs. It
is applicable to all Affymetrix genotyping arrays, including the recent ones that also
contain non-polymorphic probes. A reference signal is only needed at the last step
when calculating relative CNs.

Results:
As with our method for earlier generations of arrays, this one controls for allelic
crosstalk, probe affinities and PCR fragment-length effects. Additionally, it also corrects
for probe-sequence effects and co-hybridization of fragments digested by multiple
enzymes that takes place on the latest chips. We compare our method with Affymetrix'
CN5 method and the dChip method by assessing how well they differentiate between
various CN states at the full resolution and various amounts of smoothing. Although
the others use data from all arrays for their preprocessing, we observe that CRMA v2
performs as well as or better even if it is a single-array method. This shows that it is
possible to do online analysis in large-scale projects where additional arrays are
introduced over time.

Availability:
A bounded-memory implementation that can process any number of arrays is available
in the open-source R package aroma.affymetrix.},
