**GSE11976: Segmentation-based detection of allelic imbalance and LOH in
cancer cells using whole genome SNP arrays**  
Chip type(s): HumanCNV370v1  
Description: The proposed segmentation strategy detects allelic
imbalance originating from DNA copy number gain, loss or copy neutral
events. Here we use Illumina 317K, 370K and 550K and Affymetrix 250K
whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays hybridized with tumor
samples (breast, colon, leukemia, and urothelial) to evaluate the
segmentation strategy against several other reported methods. The data
sets include a simulated dilution series, an experimental dilution
series of a breast cancer cell line as well as paired tumor-normal
samples. This GEO series include the 12 sample experimental dilution
series of the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line (CRL-2324: www.atcc.org)
and 4 paired urothelial tumor-normal samples, all hybridized on Illumina
HumanCNV 370k BeadChips.
