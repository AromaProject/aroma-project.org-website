# Setup: Location of annotation data files

## CDF files

A *chip definition file* (CDF) contains information on which probes
belong to what probeset, the (x,y) location of each probe, which the
middle nucleotides in the target and the probe are (from which PM/MM
status is inferred), and so on.  Note that there might be multiple
different CDFs for the same chip type.

Aroma.affymetrix searches for CDF files in the annotationData/ directory
of the current working directory.  Place the CDF for chip type
<chipType> in a directory of format:

  annotationData/chipTypes/\<chip type\>/

All other CDF files with filename format \<chip type\>,\<tags\>.cdf
should also go into this directory.  For instance, so called *monocell
CDFs* named \<chip type\>,monocell.cdf, should be placed in this
directory (Footnote: Monocell CDF files are created automatically if
missing and will/should by default be written to the correct
directory.).  For example,

  annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/Mapping50K_Hind240.cdf   

annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/Mapping50K_Hind240,monocell.cdf

Moreover, the name of a CDF file *should always* be identical to the
name of the chip type followed by filename extension "cdf" (or "CDF"),
e.g. the CDF for chip type "Mapping250K_Nsp" the filename should be
"Mapping250K_Nsp.cdf". Indeed, since the CDF itself does not contain
any information about the chip type, the chip type is inferred from the
filename.

### **Example**

```r
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("Mapping50K_Hind240")
print(cdf)

AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240

## Affymetrix NetAffx CSV files

Affymetrix NetAffx CSV files are comma-separated and tabular ASCII
files containing data exported from the NetAffx data base. There is no
well-defined filename convention of these.  Place them under the
corresponding chip type directory, i.e.

  annotationData/chipTypes/\<chipType\>/

For further separation of files, they, like any other annotation file,
may be place un in subdirectories of the above, e.g.

  annotationData/chipTypes/\<chipType\>/NetAffx/

For example:

annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/NetAffx/Mapping50K_Hind240_annot.csv


### Example

```r
csv <- AffymetrixNetAffxCsvFile$byChipType("Mapping50K_Hind240", pattern="_annot[.]csv$")

## AffymetrixNetAffxCsvFile:
## Name: Mapping50K_Hind240_annot
## Tags:
## Pathname:
## annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/NetAffx/Mapping50K_Hind240_annot.csv
## File size: 59.67MB
## RAM: 0.00MB
## Columns [26]: 'Probe Set ID', 'Affy SNP ID', 'dbSNP RS ID',
## 'Chromosome', 'Genome Version', 'DB SNP Version', 'Physical Position',
## 'Strand', 'ChrX pseudo-autosomal region', 'Cytoband', 'Flank', 'Allele

## 'Fragment Length Start Stop', 'Freq Asian', 'FreqAfAm', 'Freq Cauc',

## Affymetrix probe-tab files

So called Affymetrix probe-tab files are annotation files containing
information about probe sequences etc.  They are available from the
Affymetrix web site.  These are needed in order to do, for
instance, GCRMA background correction.  Unfortunately, there is
not formal format for the names of these files, but they are typically
starting with something that looks like the chip type followed by the
suffix '*_probe_tab*' without a filename extension.  As for all
annotation files, place them under the corresponding chip type
directory, e.g.

annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/Mapping50K_Hind_probe_tab



## DChip annotation files

Aroma.affymetrix recognizes several of the dChip chip-type specific
annotation file formats, e.g. *SNP information* files and *genome
information* files.  These are available for several chip types from
<http://www.dchip.org/>.  Make sure to put these under the corresponding
directory

  annotationData/chipTypes/\<chip type\>/

The dChip files do *not* have to be renamed.  In order to organize
annotation files further, it is possible to put the files in
subdirectories of the above, e.g.

  annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/dChip/50k hind genome
info AfAm june 05 hg17.xls  
  annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/dChip/Mapping100K_Hind
snp info.txt

### Example

```r
si <- DChipSnpInformation$byChipType("Mapping50K_Hind240")
print(si)

## DChipSnpInformation:  
## Name: Mapping100K_Hind snp info  
## Tags:  
## Pathname:
## annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/dChip/Mapping100K_Hind snp
## info.txt  
## File size: 6.76MB  
## RAM: 0.00MB  
## Chip type: Mapping50K_Hind240

si <- DChipGenomeInformation$fromChipType("Mapping50K_Hind240")
print(si)

## DChipGenomeInformation:
## Name: 50k hind genome info AfAm june 05 hg17
## Tags:
## Pathname: annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping50K_Hind240/dChip/50k hind
## genome info AfAm june 05 hg17.xls
## File size: 2.47MB
## RAM: 0.00MB
## Chip type: Mapping50K_Hind240
```
