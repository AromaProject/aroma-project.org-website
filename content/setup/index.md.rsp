# Setup

All aroma.* packages are designed to have data files located in
specific directories following a strict directory structure.

Fundamental to Affymetrix data analysis is CEL and CDF files.  A CEL
file is a so called *data file*, which contains the observed signals,
whereas a chip-definition file (CDF) is a so called *annotation file*,
which contains information about the layout of a specific chip type. In
order to minimize the number of arguments specified by the user,
aroma.affymetrix looks for annotation files in pre-defined directories
as described next.

-   [Location of annotation data files](<%=pathTo('/setup/annotationData/')%>), e.g.
    CDF, ACS, UFL, ... [VOLUNTEERS: Remove/Create deprecated subpage for
    dChip annotation files]
-   [Location of raw data files](<%=pathTo('/setup/LocationOfRawDataFiles/')%>), e.g.
    CEL files.
-   [Quick Summary Of Required File
    Structure](<%=pathTo('/setup/QuickSummaryOfRequiredFileStructure/')%>)
