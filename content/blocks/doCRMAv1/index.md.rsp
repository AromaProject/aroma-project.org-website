The CRMA, or to better distinguish it from newer versions, CRMA v1, is a
preprocessing method for Affymetrix 10K-500K SNP arrays presented
in <% citet('BengtssonH_etal_2009-CRMAv1') %>.  It was optimized to
estimate high-quality total copy number (TCN) estimates from the 500K
chip type.  Later the CRMA v2 method <% citep('BengtssonH_etal_2009-CRMAv2') %>
was designed, which is what is now recommended.
However, in case CRMA v1 is wanted, we provide the `doCRMAv1()`
and `doASCRMAv1()` methods.

## Usage

```r
ds <- doCRMAv1("HapMap270,testSet", chipType="Mapping250K_Nsp")
ds <- doCRMAv1("HapMap270,testSet", chipType="Mapping50K_Hind240")
ds <- doCRMAv1("GSE8605", chipType="Mapping10K_Xba142")
```

**Argument 'verbose':** Since this will take minutes or hours, we
suggest that you add argument `verbose=-10` to see some verbose output
while processing the data set.

**The CRMA v1 is** by definition a multi-array method, which means that
it is not possible to process a subset of the arrays in a data set
without affecting the final results.  This is only possible for the
CRMA v2 method.

**Allele-specific copy-number (ASCN) estimates:**  By adding argument
`combineAlleles=FALSE` to the above, allele-specific CNs will be estimated
(for SNPs).  Alternatively, use `doASCRMAv1()`, which is short for
`doCRMAv1(..., combineAlleles=FALSE)`.  The default is to estimate total
CNs (`combineAlleles=TRUE`).  The estimated total CNs will differ slightly
when using the two alternatives and the CRMA v1 method has been optimized
for total CNs (as in CRMA paper).
