# Blocks

A block method, or short "block", is an R function that encapsulates a
complete analysis sequence of statistical methods, e.g. CRMA v2.  Blocks
are recognized by their prefix *do-*, e.g. `doCRMAv2()`.  These are
provided for convenience, and although they do not give all the
flexibility as a custom-made script, they do support the most commonly
used use cases.

**Available blocks:**

-   [doCRMAv1() / doASCRMAv1()](<%=pathTo('/blocks/doCRMAv1')%>) - Total and/or
    allele-specific copy numbers using CRMA v1.  
    Chip types: Only Affymetrix 10K-500K SNP chip types.  
    Comment: We recommend to use CRMA v2 instead.
-   [doCRMAv2()` / doASCRMAv2()](<%=pathTo('/blocks/doCRMAv2')%>) - Total and/or
    allele-specific copy numbers using CRMA v2.  
    Chip types: Any Affymetrix SNP & CN chip types (10K-GWS6).
-   doFIRMA() - FIRMA preprocessing, probe summarization, and
    alternative splicing estimation on Affymetrix exon arrays.
-   doGCRMA() - gcRMA preprocessing and probe summarization on
    Affymetrix gene expression arrays.
-   [doRMA()](<%=pathTo('/blocks/doRMA')%>) - RMA preprocessing and probe summarization
    on Affymetrix gene expression arrays.  
    Chip types: Any Affymetrix chip types.
