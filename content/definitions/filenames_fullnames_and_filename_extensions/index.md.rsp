# Definition: Filenames, fullnames and filename extensions

The current definition of a filename extension is the part of the
filename that follows the last period in the filename.  Formally, the
filename consists of a fullname, a period, and the filename extension:

```
<fullname>.<extension>
```

where `<extension>` can contain anything but a period.  Formally, the
regular expression for the period and the `<extension>` is:

```
"[.]([^.]*)$"
```


## Possible future changes

We are discussing changing the definition of a filename extension so
that it may consist of dots as well, e.g. *.birdseed.data.txt.  Note
that such a change would by definition also change the content of the
fullname.  For instance, consider filename:

```
TCGA-02-0079-01A-01D-0310-01.birdseed.data.txt
```

Currently this is parsed as:

```
fullname=TCGA-02-0079-01A-01D-0310-01.birdseed.data  
extension=txt
```

whereas in the suggested updated this would be parsed as:

```
fullname=TCGA-02-0079-01A-01D-0310-01  
extension=birdseed.data.txt
```

if the extension pattern is `"[.](birdseed[.]data[.]txt)$"`.
