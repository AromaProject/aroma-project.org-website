<% please_cite(c(
  'BengtssonH_etal_2008-aroma.affymetrix',

)) %>


## Setup

### Raw data

* Test set: BCGC_2006 (35x breast cancer samples on human exon arrays
from LBL. Unfortunately this data is currently not publically
available.)
* Path: rawData/BCGC_2006/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/

### Annotation data

Here we will use a custom CDF that consists of only 'core' probesets.
Get the following annotation files and place them in
annotationData/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/.

* HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP.cdf - the CDF defining "core" units.

This custom CDF (and also more current versions) can be downloaded from
subpage 'Affymetrix-Defined transcript clusters' on
Page [HuEx-1_0-st-v2](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/')%>).

<% alert_warn({ %>
  Do <em>not</em> use the default CDF named HuEx-1_0-st-v2.cdf that is provided by Affymetrix.
<% }) %>

Important: Make sure you replicate the structure outlined in the
[Setup](<%=pathTo('/setup')%>) pages - this will allow aroma.affymetrix to easily find
your data sets and CDFs.


#### About custom CDFs

For the exon array analysis carried out here we need to be able to map
transcript cluster IDs to exon IDs.  For this reason, we cannot use the
default CDF provided by Affymetrix (do not use it), which only have
information on exon IDs but *not on transcripts*.  Instead, we use
custom CDFs that map transcript cluster IDs to exon IDs according to
Affymetrix's definition of 'transcript clusters', cf. [ref needed].  The
above core CDF is one such *custom CDF where each unit corresponds to a
transcript cluster and each group within a unit corresponds to an
exon/probeset*.  For details on this and other alternative custom CDFs
of the same kind, see Page
[HuEx-1_0-st-v2](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2')%>).  We might also use other
gene models to group the exon.  For further alternatives, see
Page [HuEx-1_0-st-v2](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2')%>) and its subpages.

It can still be useful to have the default Affymetrix CDF as well,
however you should NOT use it for certain steps of the analysis
(particularly for the step fitting the probe model). If you make use of
the default Affymetrix CDF, make sure that you convert Affymetrix's
ASCII CDF to binary. Even if you only want probeset summaries, you don't
want to use Affymetrix's default CDF because it contains some very
strange and large probesets (> 10,000 probes) that would slow down the
processing enormously if modelled.  There is
not currently a 'cleaned-up' version of Affymetrix's default CDF that
does all the probesets but without these problem probesets. There are
also some possible omissions in Affymetrix's default CDF (see
[discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/86e48eff1e7bd457/c892034d3061d32f?lnk=gst&q=miRNA#c892034d3061d32f))
and these omissions are carried through to the custom CDFs as well.

It is highly recommended that you "tag" your results everytime you
switch CDFs (including the first time you start your analysis if with a
custom CDF). You can add a tag at each major step of the analysis.
Otherwise you can run into problems if you later use a different CDF.
See following
[discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/606ce66d425d2fae#)
for explanation and examples of tagging.

## Low-level analysis

```r
library("aroma.affymetrix")
verbose <- Arguments$getVerbose(-8, timestamp=TRUE)
```

### Setting up annotation data

In this vignette we will use a custom CDF.  In order to use that,
instead of the default CDF automatically located, we setup the CDF
explicitly as:

```r
chipType <- "HuEx-1_0-st-v2"
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType(chipType, tags="coreR2,A20070914,EP")
print(cdf)
```

This gives:

```
AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2
Filename: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP.cdf
Filesize: 38.25MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Chip type: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP
Dimension: 2560x2560
Number of cells: 6553600
Number of units: 18708
Cells per unit: 350.31
Number of QC units: 1
RAM: 0.00MB
```

### Defining CEL set

Next we setup the CEL set with the above custom CDF:

```r
cs <- AffymetrixCelSet$byName("BCGC_2006", cdf=cdf)
print(cs)
```

This gives:

```
AffymetrixCelSet:
Name: BCGC_2006
Tags:
Path: rawData/BCGC_2006/HuEx-1_0-st-v2
Chip type: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP
Number of arrays: 35
Names: BR_BT20_14_v1_WT, BR_BT474_11_v1_WT, ...,
BR_ZR75B_14_v1_WT
Time period: 2005-08-23 21:02:51 -- 2005-09-15 04:51:47
Total file size: 2199.03MB
RAM: 0.04MB
```

Note how the custom CDF is used. Otherwise by default it will search for
a CDF of the name HuEx-1_0-st-v2.cdf (and if it doesn't find it, will
produce an error). This CDF name is reserved to the default CDF provided
by Affymetrix.

There can be different stages as which you choose to start using the
custom CDF. If you want to start with using all of the probes for background
correction and normalization, you can initially have the Affymetrix CDF
(by leaving out the option `cdf` above). Then to change the CDF of any
AffymetrixCelSet (like the `cs` object above or the `csN`
post-normalization object below)

```r
setCdf(cs, cdf)
```


### Background Adjustment and Normalization

In order to do RMA background correction, we setup a correction method
and runs it by:

```r
bc <- RmaBackgroundCorrection(cs, tags="*,coreR2")
csBC <- process(bc,verbose=verbose)
```

Note that this is the first step where we will create new files, so we
have put in a tag that should follow through the rest of the analysis.

We then setup a quantile normalization method:

```r
qn <- QuantileNormalization(csBC, typesToUpdate="pm")
print(qn)
```

which gives:

```
QuantileNormalization:Data set: BCGC_2006  
Input tags: RBC,coreR2  
Output tags: QN  
Number of arrays: 35 (2199.03MB)  
Chip type: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP  
Algorithm parameters: (subsetToUpdate: NULL, typesToUpdate: chr "pm",
subsetToAvg: NULL, typesToAvg: chr "pm", .targetDistribution: NULL)  
Output path: probeData/BCGC_2006,RBC,QN/HuEx-1_0-st-v2  
Is done: FALSE
```

and we then run it by:

```r
csN <- process(qn, verbose=verbose)
```

This will take approx 30-60s per array.  Then `print(csN)` gives:

```
AffymetrixCelSet:
Name: BCGC_2006
Tags: RBC,coreR2,QN
Path: probeData/BCGC_2006,RBC,coreR2,QN/HuEx-1_0-st-v2
Chip type: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP
Number of arrays: 35
Names: BR_BT20_14_v1_WT, BR_BT474_11_v1_WT, ...,
BR_ZR75B_14_v1_WT
Time period: 2005-08-23 21:02:51 -- 2005-09-15 04:51:47
Total file size: 2199.03MB
RAM: 0.04MB
```

Note how the standard 'QN' tag is added after the composite 'BG'
correction tag (which is a combination of the standard 'RBC' and our
custom 'coreR2'). The path where the results are stored also have the
custom tag, so if we redid the analysis with a different tag (e.g. for a
different CDF) the results would be stored in a different path and thus
kept distinct. This tag will follow through the subsequent analysis, as
it did with the quantile normalization. This also means that if you go
back and rerun your code you must remember to keep the tag -- otherwise
the results will be stored in a different location and therefore all of
the calculations will be redone!

### Summarization

If you have not already done so, now is the time to set your custom CDF
(see instructions above). If at the beginning you imported the data with
the custom CDF (like the code on this page), then you do not need to do
anything -- all of the background correction and normalization steps used only the probes
defined on that CDF and each new product that was created continued to
have this CDF. You can check with the command

```r
getCdf(csN)

AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2
Filename: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP.cdf
Filesize: 38.25MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Chip type: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,coreR2,A20070914,EP
Dimension: 2560x2560
Number of cells: 6553600
Number of units: 18708
Cells per unit: 350.31
Number of QC units: 1
RAM: 0.00MB
```

There are two options, regardless of the kind of custom CDF you use. To
fit a summary of the entire transcript (i.e. estimate the overall
expression for the transcript), do:

```r
plmTr <- ExonRmaPlm(csN, mergeGroups=TRUE)
print(plmTr)
```

Otherwise, to fit exon-by-exon, change the value of `mergeGroups` to `FALSE`
in the `ExonRmaPlm()` call above.

```r
plmEx <- ExonRmaPlm(csN, mergeGroups=FALSE)
print(plmEx)
```

To fit the PLM to all of the data, do:

```r
fit(plmTr, verbose=verbose)
```

or similarly for `plmEx`. This will roughly take a few minutes per array
if you are using the core probesets only.


#### Quality assessment of PLM fit

To calculate the residuals from the PLM fit, do:

```r
rs <- calculateResidualSet(plmTr, verbose=verbose)
```

To browse spatial false-colored images of the residuals, do:

```r
ae <- ArrayExplorer(rs)
setColorMaps(ae, c("log2,log2neg,rainbow", "log2,log2pos,rainbow"))
process(ae, interleaved="auto", verbose=verbose)
display(ae)
```

This will take 30-60 seconds per array. Note that you will only have
proper residuals for the probes you used in your fit -- i.e. the ones in
the custom CDF you chose. So these plots may be of lesser value.

To examine NUSE and RLE plots, do

```r
qamTr <- QualityAssessmentModel(plmTr)
plotNuse(qamTr)
plotRle(qamTr)
```

Note that this can be done to fits based on the transcript level or exon
level depending on which PLM you chose and can give different
interpretations.

To extract the estimates (transcript or probeset) use either
`extractMatrix()` or `extractDataFrame()` on the ChipEffectSet that
corresponds to the PLM object:

```r
cesTr <- getChipEffectSet(plmTr)
trFit <- extractDataFrame(cesTr, units=1:3, addNames=TRUE)
```

This will give a data.frame with three rows, each row corresponding to a
unit/transcript. To get all units, choose `units=NULL`. The `addNames=TRUE` argument adds the unit and group names to the entries of the data frame, but will take longer the first time you process this chip type. Note that if you had `mergeGroups=TRUE`, there is no 'group' or
exon estimate, but `extractDataFrame()` will still return a group name.
This will always be the first probeset in the transcript and should be
ignored -- it has nothing to do with the estimate but is simply an
artifact of how the data is stored.

To get estimates of the probesets/exons you must choose
`mergeGroups=FALSE` as described above when you define your PLM object,
and then extract the estimates from it.

```r
cesEx <- getChipEffectSet(plmEx)
exFit <- extractDataFrame(cesEx, units=1:3, addNames=TRUE)
```

This will return a data frame with 27 rows equal to the 4+15+8 exons
that are in the first three units. Again, `units=NULL` gives all exons.
Note that you can also `readUnits()` to get the output in the traditional
list format (applied to either `cesEx` or `cesTr`, as appropriate). However,
if you are then going to unlist it into a matrix form, use
`extractMatrix()` or `extractDataFrame()` -- it will be much safer.

<% alert_warn({ %>
 Do <em>not</em> use `getData()`, `getIntensities()` or any other such commands to get transcript or exon summaries.
<% }) %>


## Alternative Splicing Analysis (FIRMA)

The FIRMA analysis _only_ works from the PLM based on transcripts.

```r
firma <- FirmaModel(plmTr)
fit(firma, verbose=verbose)
fs <- getFirmaScores(firma)
```

You can extract the FIRMA scores in the same way as the transcript/exon
estimates with `extractDataFrame()` applied to `fs`.
