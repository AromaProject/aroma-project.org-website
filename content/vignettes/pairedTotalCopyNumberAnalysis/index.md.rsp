## Setup

If this is your first analysis within the aroma project, please make sure to first read the '[Setup](<%=pathTo('/setup/')%>)' and '[Definition](<%=pathTo('/definitions/')%>)' pages.  This will explain the importance of following a well defined directory structure and file names.  *Understanding this is important and will save you a lot of time*.


### Raw data

```
rawData/
  Lee10Lung/
    GenomeWideSNP_6/
      GSM517071.CEL, GSM517072.CEL
  GSE20584/
    GenomeWideSNP_6/
      GSM517071.CEL, GSM517072.CEL
```

These GenomeWideSNP_6 CEL files are available from GEO under <% geo('GSE20584') %>.

### Annotation data

Affymetrix provides two different CDF files for the GenomeWideSNP_6
chip type, namely the "default" and "full" CDF.  The full CDF contains
what the default one does plus more.  We are always using the full CDF.
If we want to do filtering, we do it afterward.

```
annotationData/
  chipTypes/
    GenomeWideSNP_6/
      GenomeWideSNP_6,Full.cdf
      GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,na26,HB20080821.ugp
      GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,na26,HB20080722.ufl
      GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,HB20080710.acs
```
Note that the CDF was renamed from *.Full.cdf to *,Full.cdf (with a
comma).  The UGP, UFL, and ACS files are special aroma.affymetrix
annotation files available from 
'[GenomeWideSNP_6](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_6/')%>)'.  The CDF file is
available from Affymetrix inside the "Library Files" (via the same
page).

## Analysis startup

```r
library("aroma.affymetrix")
verbose <- Arguments$getVerbose(-8, timestamp=TRUE)
# Don't display too many decimals.
options(digits=4)
```

## Preprocessing using CRMAv2
Here we will use the CRMA v2 <% citep('BengtssonH_etal_2009-CRMAv2') %> method to estimate copy numbers.
```r
dataSet <- "GSE20584"
chipType <- "GenomeWideSNP_6"
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType(chipType, tags="Full")
dsList <- doCRMAv2(dataSet, cdf=cdf, combineAlleles=FALSE, verbose=verbose)
dsC <- dsList$total
print(dsC)
```

This gives

```
AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet:
Name: GSE20584
Tags: ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY
Full name: GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY
Number of files: 2
Names: GSM517071, GSM517072 [2]
Path (to the first file): totalAndFracBData/GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY/GenomeWideSNP_6
Total file size: 14.35 MB
RAM: 0.00MB
```
Note, above we use the allele-specific version of CRMAv2 (`combineAlleles=FALSE`). Alternatively, one could do

```r
dsC <- doASCRMAv2(dataSet, cdf=cdf, verbose=verbose)
print(dsC)
```
to get total intensity estimates directly, but since you may want to look at allele-specific estimates in the future, we calculate allele-specific CNs already now.


### Splitting the data set in (tumor, normal) pairs

In this example, we have only one pair: "GSM517071" is the tumor sample,
and "GSM517072" is the normal sample.

```r
# Split data set in (tumor, normal) pair
idxT <- match("GSM517071", getNames(dsC))
dsT <- dsC[idxT]

idxN <- match("GSM517072", getNames(dsC))
dsN <- dsC[idxN]
```

This can be adapted to cases where several tumor/normal pairs are
avaiable.

### Setting up paired CBS model

```r
cns <- CbsModel(dsT, dsN)
print(cns)
```

which gives

```
CbsModel
Name: GSE20584
Tags: ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY,paired
Chip type (virtual): GenomeWideSNP_6
Path: cbsData/GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY,paired/GenomeWideSNP_6
Number of chip types: 1
Sample & reference file pairs:
Chip type #1 of 1 ('GenomeWideSNP_6'):
Sample data set:
AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet:
Name: GSE20584
Tags: ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY
Full name: GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY
Number of files: 1
Names: GSM517071 [1]
Path (to the first file):
totalAndFracBData/GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY/GenomeWideSNP_6
Total file size: 7.18 MB
RAM: 0.00MB
Reference data set/file:
AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet:
Name: GSE20584
Tags: ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY
Full name: GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY
Number of files: 1
Names: GSM517072 [1]
Path (to the first file): totalAndFracBData/GSE20584,ACC,ra,-XY,BPN,-XY,AVG,FLN,-XY/GenomeWideSNP_6
Total file size: 7.18 MB
RAM: 0.00MB
```

This tells us that GSM517071 is used as the "Sample" and "GSM517072 as
the "Reference".

At this stage the segmentation has not been performed yet; we have this
far only setup the CBS model.  To run the segmentation on one
chromosome, do:

```r
# Perform CBS segmentation on one chromosome
fit(cns, chromosome=12, verbose=verbose)
```

To run the segmentation on all chromosomes (sequentially), do:

```r
# Perform CBS segmentation for all chromosomes
fit(cns, verbose=verbose)
```

### Extracting segmentation results

```r
regDatList <- getRegions(cns, chromosome=12)
regDat <- regDatList[[1]]
regDat[1:10, 1:5]
```

This gives
```
   chromosome    start     stop    mean count
1          12    20704   739460  0.6830   440
2          12   739525   744291  1.5144    16
3          12   745616  1767217  0.7499   613
4          12  1770996  5119549  0.6473  2714
5          12  5122506  7192288  0.3636  1419
6          12  7192988  8447961  0.4240   599
7          12  8449756  8485921 -0.0008    23
8          12  8486162 13374527  0.4269  3444
9          12 13375092 13839537  0.3822   502
10         12 13843034 19572213  0.7679  3573
```

### Displaying results of copy number analysis using ChromosomeExplorer

```r
# Link the ChromosomeExplorer to the segmentation model
ce <- ChromosomeExplorer(cns)
print(ce)

# Fit the model for a few chromosomes
process(ce, chromosomes=c(12, 13, 17), verbose=verbose)
```
