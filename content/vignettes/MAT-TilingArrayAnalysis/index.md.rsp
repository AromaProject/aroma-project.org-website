## Setup

### Annotation data

There are some considerations to be made for creating CDF files for
tiling arrays, since probes are not originally organized into probesets
as with expression arrays.  The full story of how to create a CDF file
from the 'bpmap' files that Affymetrix makes available can be viewed at
the [Creating CDF (and associated) files from BpMap files (tiling
arrays)](<%=pathTo('/howtos/bpmapCluster2Cdf')%>) page.  For the Human Promoter 1.0R array, you can download a custom-created CDF file (and associated
annotation) from chiptype page
[Hs_PromPR_v02](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/Hs_PromPR_v02')%>).

For analysis of human promoter tiling arrays, be sure to put the CDF
file and associated files in your:
```
  annotationData/chipTypes/Hs_PromPR_v02/
```
directory.

Important: As always, make sure you replicate the structure outlined in
Sections [Setting up annotation files](<%=pathTo('/setup')%>) and [Structure of data
set directories](<%=pathTo('/setup')%>) - this will allow aroma.affymetrix to easily
find your data sets and CDFs.


### Raw data

For illustration, we use a publicly available dataset of the Human
Promoter 1.0R array.  The CEL files for this dataset as well as sample
annotation information can be downloaded from
ArrayExpress <% arrayexpress('E-MEXP-1481') %> data set.
In brief, this experiment hybridizes DNA fragments pulled down using an antibody to methylated DNA, a so-called MeDIP-chip experiment.  The analysis presented here would be similar for ChIP-chip experiments.

Following standard procedure of organizing files within
aroma.affymetrix, the CEL files are put into the:
```
  rawData/novakMeDIP/Hs_PromPR_v02/
```
directory, making 'novakMeDIP' the experiment name.

## Low-level analysis

We first start by loading the package and setting the verbosity level:

```r
library("aroma.affymetrix")
verbose <- Arguments$getVerbose(-8, timestamp=TRUE)
```

### Getting annotation data files

If you have downloaded (or created) the CDF file correctly for your
tiling array, you should see a result similar to this:

```r
chipType <- "Hs_PromPR_v02"
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType(chipType)
print(cdf)
```

This gives:

```
AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/Hs_PromPR_v02
Filename: Hs_PromPR_v02.cdf
Filesize: 61.95MB
Chip type: Hs_PromPR_v02
RAM: 0.00MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Dimension: 2166x2166
Number of cells: 4691556
Number of units: 23155
Cells per unit: 202.62
Number of QC units: 0
```


### Defining the CEL set

Next we setup the CEL set with the above custom CDF, assuming the data
has been deposited in the correct directories:

```r
cs <- AffymetrixCelSet$byName("novakMEDIP", cdf=cdf)
print(cs)
```

This gives:

```
AffymetrixCelSet:
Name: novakMEDIP
Tags:
Path: rawData/novakMEDIP/Hs_PromPR_v02
Platform: Affymetrix
Chip type: Hs_PromPR_v02
Number of arrays: 25
Names: 1139T-MeCIP, 120T-MeCIP, ..., HMEC-MeCIP
Time period: 2006-12-19 12:22:42 -- 2007-10-19 13:42:56
Total file size: 1121.82MB
RAM: 0.02MB
```

### MAT (Model-based Analysis of Tiling Arrays) Normalization

[MAT](http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MAT/) is a commonly used method to
process and summarize tiling array data.  An implementation of MAT has
now been created within aroma.affymetrix.  MAT is actually two steps.
First, a linear model for normalization is fitted, encompassing a
probe's sequence content, position-specific aspects and 'copy number'
(the number of times in the genome it hits).  The model is fit on a
large number of probes (here, all PM probes) and residuals from this
model are used in downstream calculations, such as smoothing.  The
parameters in this model are estimated separately.  Although not
presently available, there is scope to either include more terms in this
normalization model or specify an alternative model.

To setup the MAT normalization, you can call:

```r
mn <- MatNormalization(cs)
```

A call to `print(mn)` gives:

```
MatNormalization:
Data set: novakMEDIP
Input tags:
User tags: *
Asterisk ('*') tags: MN,lm
Output tags: MN,lm
Number of files: 25 (1121.82MB)
Platform: Affymetrix
Chip type: Hs_PromPR_v02
Algorithm parameters: (unitsToFit: NULL, typesToFit: chr "pm",
unitsToUpdate: NULL, typesToUpdate: chr "pm", shift: num 0, target:
NULL, model: chr "lm", numChunks: int 15)
Output path: probeData/novakMEDIP,MN,lm/Hs_PromPR_v02
Is done: FALSE
RAM: 0.00MB
```

To run the MAT normalization, applied separately to each sample, call:

```r
csN <- process(mn, verbose=verbose)
```

### Unique-ifying the CDF file

Because some of the probes on the Affymetrix Human Promoter 1.0R tiling
chip map to multiple genome locations, some individual probe data will
get used multiple times.  Instead of tracking this information within
aroma.affymetrix, it is easiest to create a "unique-ified" copy of the
data before applying the second step of MAT.  This is simply a
reorganization of the data.  To do this, you will need to call the
following command (on MAT-normalized data):

```r
csU <- convertToUnique(csN, verbose=verbose)
```

The first time this is run, it does the copying.  After that, rerunning
the same script will recognize that it has already been done and return
the unique-ified AffymetrixCelSet object almost instantly.

You may also like to get access to the 'unique' CDF:

```r
cdfU <- getUniqueCdf(cdf, verbose=verbose)
```

Then, `print(cdfU)` gives:

```
AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/Hs_PromPR_v02
Filename: Hs_PromPR_v02,unique.CDF
Filesize: 61.95MB
Chip type: Hs_PromPR_v02,unique
RAM: 0.00MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Dimension: 2088x2088
Number of cells: 4359744
Number of units: 23155
Cells per unit: 188.29
Number of QC units: 0
```

Note that the number of units is identical to before (i.e. as within the
CDF object defined above), but the number of probes has changed slightly
(control probes are dropped and some probes query multiple locations).

## Summarizing

### MAT Smoothing

MAT implements a trimmed mean smoothing step at every probe.  Basically,
the probes that interrogate genomic regions nearby a given probe are
used to summarize the intensity (here, operating on the residuals from
the MAT normalization).  To calculate MAT scores, we need to know which
samples are to be combined or are to be compared to each other.  A
convenient way to do this is via a contrast matrix.  Note that this is
not a contrast matrix in the classical sense, but basically a nice
compact way to specify how samples are summarized.

Say we wanted to calculate a MAT score for 2 different possibilites:

1. a difference between 2 samples
2. a difference between a group of 3 samples to a group of 2 samples.

Using the sample names (which are derived from the original file names),
we can use the limma package to make the contrast matrix easily.  For
example, the example below calculates 2 MAT scores, one for the
difference between samples "1139T-MeCIP" and "120T-MeCIP" and another
comparing the pool of 3, say {"1139T-MeCIP", "120T-MeCIP",
"2845T-MeCIP"} to a pool of 2: {"5343N-MeCIP",  "5358N_MeCIP"}.  To
this, use the following commands:

```r
library("limma")
levels <- make.names(getNames(csU))
 con <- makeContrasts(
         contrasts=c("X1139T.MeCIP-X120T.MeCIP",
                     "(X1139T.MeCIP+X120T.MeCIP+X2845T.MeCIP)-(X5343N.MeCIP+X5358N_MeCIP)"),
         levels=levels)
colnames(con) <- c("ms1139T-120T","msG3-G2")
```

Take care to give meaningful 'colnames' of the matrix.  These are used
as the names (and filenames on disk) for the samples of the output
object.  Note that the Xs and dots are needed here to make syntactically
correct R variables.  You may not need to do this for your experiments.
We only needed to do this here since some of the original CEL file names
started with a number or contained the '-' character.  Depending on how
your CEL files are named you may also wish to use the
`setFullNamesTranslator()` approach, as discussed on Page ['Empirical
probe-signal densities and rank-based quantile
normalization](<%=pathTo('/vignettes/probe-signal_densities_and_rank-based_quantile_normalization')%>)'.

Just so that the slight change in names here is transparent, consider
the command:

```r
cbind(names=getNames(csU), levels)
```

giving:

```
      names                      levels
[1,] "1139T-MeCIP"              "X1139T.MeCIP"

```

One thing to note: the actual numbers in the contrast matrix (`-1` or `1`
here) are not used in any of the computations (which is why I mention
above that these are not strictly contrast matrices).  Only the **sign**
of the numbers is used.  That is, all the positive numbers are averaged
and all the negative numbers are averaged, and then differences are
taken to create the MAT scores.  This follows the original
implementation.  Please read the MAT paper for more details.

To create and run the smoothing, you can call the following commands:

```r
ms <- MatSmoothing(csU, design=con, probeWindow=1000)
csMS <- process(ms, verbose=verbose)
```

### Outputting results (available soon)

One thing users might want to do is output the smoothed results to a
file that can loaded into Affymetrix's Integrated Genome Browser (IGB).
You can do this by calling:

```r
writeSgr(csMS)
```

Note that the object created above, `csMS`, is an AffymetrixCelSet object
and any other methods for such objects can be used to extract the data
of interest, e.g. `extractMatrix()`,  `readUnits()`.


## Appendix

Here is a complete list of commands from above, in case you want to cut
and paste them all at once:

```r
library("aroma.affymetrix")
verbose <- Arguments$getVerbose(-8, timestamp=TRUE)


chipType <- "Hs_PromPR_v02"

cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType(chipType, verbose=verbose)

cs <- AffymetrixCelSet$byName("novakMEDIP", cdf=cdf, verbose=verbose)

mn <- MatNormalization(cs, numChunks=15)
csN <- process(mn, verbose=verbose)

csU <- convertToUnique(csN, verbose=verbose)
cdfU <- getUniqueCdf(cdf, verbose=verbose)

library("limma")
levels <- make.names(getNames(csU))
 con <- makeContrasts(
         contrasts=c("X1139T.MeCIP-X120T.MeCIP",
                     "(X1139T.MeCIP+X120T.MeCIP+X2845T.MeCIP)-(X5343N.MeCIP+X5358N_MeCIP)"),
         levels=levels)
colnames(con) <- c("ms1139T-120T","msG3-G2")

ms <- MatSmoothing(csU, design=con, probeWindow=1000)
csMS <- process(ms, verbose=verbose)
```
