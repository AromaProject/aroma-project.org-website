# Get involved

The aroma project is a collaborative project where software developed is
release as open source and all documentation is freely available.  As
the project and its number of users grows the project needs help to keep
up.  You can help out in many ways:

-   Answer questions on the forum - if you think you have an answer,
    please reply.
-   Create new documentation such as Vignettes and How tos - if you're
    sitting on useful tutorials/scripts, please consider sharing them
    here.
-   Improve existing documentation - if you find typos, grammar errors,
    code errors or outdated information, please report/contribute
    updates via the mailing list.
-   Contribute with annotation data - if you have went through the
    efforts of to build annotation data files, please consider sharing
    them.  We can host the data files.
-   Contribute with add ons - if you develop new models/methods on top
    of the aroma framework you are welcome to share them here.  More
    users means feedback and higher quality in the long run.
-   Anything else you can think of.

Specific needs:

-   ~~Update the HTML and Javascript of ArrayExplorer and
    ChromosomeExplorer to work again (they only work with Firefox
    3.0-3.1).~~  Solved in aroma.affymetrix v2.5.0 with great help from
    Keith Ching and Laurent Malvert.

Just drop a message to the mailing list/forum, if you are willing to
help out.  Thanks!
