### BRB-ArrayTools

Authors: Richard Simon & BRB-ArrayTools Development Team  
Operating system: Windows with MS Excel  
Description: "BRB-ArrayTools is an integrated package for the
visualization and statistical analysis of DNA microarray gene expression
data. It was developed by professional statisticians experienced in the
analysis of microarray data and involved in the development of improved
methods for the design and analysis of microarray based experiments. The
array tools package utilizes an Excel front end. Scientists are familiar
with Excel and utilizing Excel as the front end makes the system
portable and not tied to any database. [...]"

Operating system: Java  
Description: "EXPANDER (EXpression Analyzer and DisplayER) is a
java-based tool for analysis of gene expression data. It is capable of
(1) clustering (2) visualizing (3) biclustering and (4) performing
downstream analysis of clusters and biclusters such as functional
enrichment and promoter analysis. In particular, it can analyze groups
of genes for enrichment of transcription factor binding sites in their
promoters."
