# How tos

## Packages

-   [Install / update aroma.* packages](<%=pathTo('/install/')%>)



## Directories and files

-   [Access CEL files in a non-standard directory using
    links](<%=pathTo('/howtos/how-access-cel-files-non-standard-directory')%>)
-   [Use fullname translators to rename data
    files](<%=pathTo('/howtos/setFullNamesTranslator')%>)
-   Use fullname translators to rename data sets [VOLUNTEERS NEEDED]



## Setting up data sets

-   Setting up an AffymetrixCelSet
-   Setting up a ChipEffectSet
-   Setting up a SnpChipEffectSet or a CnChipEffectSet
-   [Setting up an AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet or an
    AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet](<%=pathTo('/howtos/SetupOfAromaUnitNnnCnBinarySet')%>)



## Subsettings

-   Extracting a sub dataset from a data set
-   Extracting a single data file from a data set
-   Indexing data files by their names
-   Indexing data files by a regular expression matching their names



## Calculations

-   Calculate the average signals of any number of samples
-   [Calculate total copy number ratios from from total
    (non-polymorphic) signals](<%=pathTo('/howtos/exportTotalCnRatioSet')%>)



## Export signals

-   [Export total copy numbers and allele B fractions as aroma binary
    data files](<%=pathTo('/howtos/exportTotalAndFracB')%>) [DOC IN PROGRESS]
-   [Write total copy numbers and allele B fractions as tab-delimited
    text files](<%=pathTo('/howtos/writeDataFrame')%>) [DOC IN PROGRESS]



## Extract data as basic R objects

-   [Extract probeset summaries (chip effects) as a data
    frame](<%=pathTo('/howtos/extractDataFrame')%>)
-   [Extract probeset summaries (chip effects) as a multi-dimensional
    array](<%=pathTo('/howtos/extractTheta')%>)



## Extract data as objects recognized by Bioconductor packages

Both probe-level data and probe-summary data can be exported by aroma.*
packages for further analysis in Bioconductor.  Note that most of *these
methods will export data as in-memory object*, because that is how most
of Bioconductor is designed.  For large probe-level data set this often
means that it is not possible not export the complete data set.  For
probe-summarized data, an order of magnitude larger data sets can be
exported, but for really large data sets working with in-memory object
will also become a problem.

-   [Extract probe signals as an 'affy' AffyBatch
    object](<%=pathTo('/howtos/extractAffyBatch')%>)
-   [Extract probeset summaries (chip effects) as a 'Biobase'
    ExpressionSet object](<%=pathTo('/howtos/extractExpressionSet')%>)
-   [Extract probeset summaries (chip effects) as an 'oligo' SnpQSet or
    SnpCnvQSet object](<%=pathTo('/howtos/extractSnpQSet')%>)
-   [Use aroma.* data within Bioconductor](<%=pathTo('/howtos/using_aroma_in_bioc')%>)

## Interaction with Bioconductor packages

    elsewhere](<%=pathTo('/howtos/MigrateAndReproduceAnAnalysisElsewhere')%>)
-   [Migrating all or parts of a project to another file
    system](<%=pathTo('/howtos/migrate_to_other_system')%>) [VOLUNTEERS NEEDED]
-   [Run CRMA v2 on a subset of arrays in a data
    set](<%=pathTo('/howtos/CRMAv2_on_subset_of_arrays')%>)
