# How to: Use aroma.* data within Bioconductor

Author: Henrik Bengtsson

Both probe-level data and probe-summary data can be exported by
aroma.affymetrix for further analysis in Bioconductor.  Note that most
of these methods will export data as in-memory object, because that is
how most of Bioconductor is designed.  For large probe-level data set
this often means that it is not possible not export the complete data
set.  For probe-summarized data, an order of magnitude larger data sets
can be exported, but for really large data sets working with in-memory
object will also become a problem.

## Exporting probe-summary data

Probe-summarized data can be exported in various ways depending on chip
type.

### ChipEffectSet as exprSet

Chip effects can be exported as an exprSet object (defined in the <% bioc('Biobase') %> package) by calling:


```r
es <- extractExprSet(ces)
```

where `ces` is a ChipEffectSet.  The extracted object will be annotated
with as much information as possible at the time of the call.  Note that
this will load all data in to memory.

### ChipEffectSet as eSet

Chip effects can be exported as an eSet object (defined in the <% bioc('Biobase') %> package) by calling:

```r
es <- extractESet(ces)
```

The extracted object will be annotated with as much information as
possible at the time of the call.  Note that this will load all data in
to memory.


### Fitted ProbeLevelModel as PLMset

*Fitted* ProbeLevelModel:s can be exported as an PLMset object (defined
in the <% bioc('affyPLM') %> package) by calling:

```r
ps <- extractPLMset(plm)
```

This call requires that the PLM has been fitted for all units, otherwise
part of the results will be zero or `NA`.  The extracted object will be
annotated with as much information as possible at the time of the call.
Note that this will load all data in to memory.
