# How to: Use Bioconductor data in aroma.*

Data in a FeatureSet object (defined on the <% bioc('oligo') %> package) can be
imported to aroma.affymetrix by:

```r
cs <- AffymetrixCelSet$createFromFeatureSet(fs)
```

where `fs` is a FeatureSet object.  This will create a new set of CEL
files.  After being imported, aroma.affymetrix do not need the
FeatureSet object anymore.
