# How to: Use filenames longer than 255 characters on Windows

The maximum number of symbols in a Windows pathname is 256, including
file separators '/' or '\\', but excluding the drive letter, and initial
file separator (e.g. 'C:/'), and the string terminator ('\\0'), cf.
[MSDN - Naming a File or Directory](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247\(VS.85\).aspx).
 In R, the limit is one symbol less, i.e. 255.

## Example
Here is an example of a very long pathname:

```r
# Working directory:
pwd <- getwd()
print(pwd)
## [1] "C:/Users/AromaUser/Project_2010/TCGA,GBM,analysis/redundancyTests/"

# Result directory:
path <- "cbsData/broad.mit.edu_GBM.Genome_Wide_SNP_6.4.5.0,pairs/GenomeWideSNP_6/"

# Filename
filename <- "TCGA-06-0208,01A,01D-0236-01,ratios,ref=TCGA-06-0208,10A,01D-0237-01,log2ratio,total,chr09,dbc39899be02529b41df0a9416537f0a.xdr"

# Complete pathname
pathname <- file.path(pwd, path, filename)
print(nchar(pathname))

## [1] 267
```

## Symptom
This limitation typically reveals itself as "file" errors.  One example
is `"In gzfile(file, "wb") : cannot open compressed file '<long pathname>',
probable reason 'No such file or directory'`.  Another
example is `"Error in dirname(pathname) : file name conversion problem"`.

## Workaround

1.  Use a working directory that is higher up in the directory
    structure, e.g. instead of 'C:/way/too/long/path/' use 'C:/short/path/'.
2.  The [Windows/MS-DOS] console
    '[subst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subst)' utility makes a drive
    letter to any Windows directory, e.g.
	`subst Y: 'C:/Documents and Settings/JohnDoe/Documents/My Research/Projects/aroma.affymetrix/ProjectA/'`.
3.  The following <% cran('R.utils') %> solution maps the current working directory to 'Y:' (using the above internally) and updates the working directory
    to be 'Y:/':  

```r
setwd(System$mapDriveOnWindows("Y:"))
```

<% alert_warn({ %>
<strong>Not a workaround:</strong>
 Unfortunately it is <em>not</em> a solution to try to use relative instead
 of absolute pathnames.  The limitation is deep down in the file
 system itself and it is the absolute pathname that counts.
