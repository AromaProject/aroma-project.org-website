I am collecting here functions that Mark Robinson and I have developed
to create CDFs from scratch. Ultimately the goal will be to create
single R functions, but right now these are functions that make up a
series of steps (not all of which are in Perl).

An example of steps for Ensembl CDF for the exon array:

1.  Download the Ensembl Annotation with <% bioc('biomaRt') %> and use it
    to map the Affymetrix **probesets** (exons) to the gene boundaries in
	Ensembl using
    [annotateProbesets.R](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/annotateProbesets.R')%>)
2.  Make single file of all probes and their mapping with
    [convertProbesetCSV_differentInput.pl](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/convertProbesetCSV_differentInput.pl')%>)
    (i.e. now map the corresponding probes)
3.  Create CDF with
    [flat2Cdf.R](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090624/flat2Cdf.R')%>)

To filter, see example below.


## Make CDF (Main File)

The main file
[flat2Cdf.R](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090624/flat2Cdf.R')%>)
contains `flat2Cdf()` for making the CDF, which is a function in R that
takes a 'flat' file and converts it to a binary CDF file. The flat file
is a tab-delimited file with each row corresponding to a probe to be
included in the CDF.  Right now the format of a 'flat' file is a bit
rigid.

It must be:

-   tab-delimited
-   have a header row
-   A column 'X' and 'Y' with the x,y coordinates of a file (there is an
    argument that allows to pass other names, but not really tested yet)
-   A column identifying a probe to a group and a column identifying a
    probe to a unit (for exon arrays, group=exon, unit=gene; for gene
    arrays, unit=group=gene); these identifications will the group and
    unit names respectively.
-   Other columns are allowed and will be ignored.

```
Example:  
Probe_ID        X       Y       Probe_Sequence  Group_ID
Unit_ID  
15      14      0       TCTCCAGTGAAGTGCACATTGCTCA       3029044

ENSG00000130226  
35      34      0       TCTGGAAATGCATCAGGGACATCTG       3087574

ENSG00000138738  
59      58      0       TATGTGACTGGATTGCAAGTCTCTC       2403372

62      61      0       CATGTAGATCTATGCCAGTTGAATC       2507416
ENSG00000048991
```

The R function takes the following arguments:

-   `filename`: of flat file
-   `chipType`: the chip type of the CDF
-   `tags`: tags to add to the chip type
-   `ucol`: integer giving the column with the unit id
-   `gcol`: integer giving the column with the group id (can be same as unit id)
-   `col.class`: column classes of file (see help on `read.table()`);
-   `splitn`: parameter that controls the number of initial chunks that
    are unwrapped (number of characters of unit names used to keep units
    together for initial chunks)
-   `rows`: number of rows on the array  
    `cols`: number of columns on the array
-   `xynames`: names for the X,Y columns

Example (within R):

```r
flat2Cdf(file="hjay.r1.flat", chipType="hjay", tag="r1,TC")
```


## Convert Affymetrix annotation to Flat file (Perl)

Affymetrix generally has one file that gives the probe to probeset
identification. Then there might be a separate file that relates probesets
to genes. This information must be combined to get a single flat file
for `flat2Cdf()`. The Perl script
[convertProbesetCSV_differentInput.pl](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/convertProbesetCSV_differentInput.pl')%>) converts
these files to an output 'flat' file. This may not work for all input (I
use the file *.probe.tab from Affymetrix).

It takes 3 arguments:

1.  a file with the probeset assignments to genes (comma-delimited, one
    row per probeset)
2.  file with probe assignments to probesets (tab-delimited, one row per
    probe, e.g. *.probe.tab)
3.  outfile name (will be tab-delimited)

Optional arguments concerning the first file:

```
-p column with the probeset (default 1)
-g column with the genes (default 2)
```

Example (system command line; one row):

```sh
convertProbesetCSV_differentInput.pl ensembl2affy.csv MoEx-1_0-st-v1.probe.tab MoEnsembl50.flat -p 1 -g 6
```


## Map probesets to outside gene definition

The `annotateProbesets()` function (R
script [annotateProbesets.R](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/annotateProbesets.R')%>)) is
for taking Affymetrix's probesets ('psr') and mapping them to a
different gene definition. This might be a bit exon array specific. It
was designed for Human Ensembl annotation, though I used it for Mouse.
It could be extended to be just probes, perhaps.

This is an R function with the following arguments:

-   `probesetFile`: file name with the psr regions
-   `exonBoundariesFile`: file name of delimited file with the exon
    boundaries that you want to map the probesets to (new gene
    definitions)
-   `probesetFileParameters`, `exonBoundariesFileParameters`: list of
    parameters to pass to `read.table()` in reading the file; note that
    `header=TRUE` and `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` are hard-coded in and can not
    be changed by user (and should not be passed in this argument)
-   `probesetFileNames`: vector of the header (names) of the necessary
    columns to match the probeset to the annotation (see default
    assignments to see what these are). This allows the user to have a
    file with different headers, which will be detected and converted to
    the standard headers in the default. Note that the order of this
    argument is ESSENTIAL. Also, the sixth value (by default `NA`) can be
    an additional column (like level); it is only used to table the
    matching and non-matching probesets in the verbose output, so is not
    essential. All columns will be returned in the final output (though
    in different order)
-   `exonFileNames`: similar to probesetFileNames, but see default to see
    the specifics for the `exonBoundariesFile`. Note that if
    gene_id=exon_id, and the stop and start are the boundaries of the
    gene, it should just map to the gene and not coding region specific.
-   `overlapType`: either a character vector specifying overlap type or a
    user-defined function that returns the fraction of overlap of a set
    of genes (untested, see internal code to see operation of function).
    If character vector, should be either `"none"` (no adjustment),
	`"probeset"` (percentage of probeset overlap in the resulting merged
    gene), `"coding"` (untested -- the percentage of coding overlap as
    fraction of coding length of resulting merged gene), or `"genomic"`
    (untested-the percentage of genomic overlap as fraction of length of
    the resulting merged gene)
-   `overlapCutoff`: between 0 and 1; the required shared region required to
    merge genes together (as defined by `overlapType` function); if genes
    are not merged, the overlapping probesets are removed.

Some strange assumptions about the files (should be fixed...):

-   'probesets' file assumes Affymetrix format for chromosome data:
    chr1, chr2, etc. and +/- for strand
-   assume numeric for chromosomes in exonBoundaries (1-24)...; and -1/1
    for strand
-   assumes that X,Y is encoded as 23,24 in exonBoundaries...very human
    specific, should be careful

Description of the overlapping strategy (It is run after probesets are
assigned to genes based on the inputted `exonBoundariesFile`.)

1.  If `overlapType` is `"none"` there is no further action done (and
    probesets can be assigned to multiple genes)
2.  When there is overlap (defined as probesets assigned to multiple
    genes, and not based on the external exon boundaries), there is an
    initial scan that creates groups of genes that overlap (if A
    overlaps B and B overlaps C, but C does not overlap A, then A,B,C are
    still all included in an overlapping group).
3.  For each group, the % that are common to all of the genes in the
    group is calculated based on the function given by `overlapType`.
4.  If this % is greater or equal to `overlapCutoff` then the genes in the
    group (and *all* of their probesets, regardless of which gene they
    are from) are merged into one gene.
5.  Otherwise all of the genes are kept distinct and *any* overlapping
    probesets are removed.
6.  `overlapCutoff=1` means that only genes with 100% overlap (as defined
    by the function in `overlapType`) are merged and otherwise probesets
    mapped to multiple genes are removed.
7.  `overlapCutoff > 1` means there is absolutely no merging of genes, even
    if 100% equivalent (note: error is returned if `overlapType` returns
    \> 1)
8.  The merged gene has a name that is the concatenation of the names of
    the genes in the set: "Gene1.Gene2.Gene3" etc.

Example Usage:

```r
path <- "HumanEnsembl50Build"
probesetName <- file.path(path, "HuEx-1_0-st-v2.na26.hg18.probeset.csv")
annotExonBoundaries <- file.path(path, "exonBoundaries_proteinCoding_20080819.txt")

colClasses <- rep("NULL", 39); # 39=number of columns in HuEx-1_0-st-v2.naXX.hg18.probeset.csv
colClasses[c(1:5,16)] <- NA;   # the columns that I want to pull in
overlapType <- "probeset"
overlapCutoff <- 1.0
pbsetHeaderNames <- c("probeset_id", "seqname", "strand", "start", "stop", "level")
exonHeaderNames <- c("gene_id", "exon_id", "chr", "strand", "start", "end")
annotateProbesets(probesetFile=probesetName,
    exonBoundariesFile=annotExonBoundaries,
    probesetFileParameters=list(sep=",", colClasses=colClasses, comment.char="#"),
    probesetFileNames=pbsetHeaderNames,
    exonBoundariesFileParameters=list(sep="\t", colClasses=NA, comment.char="#"),
    exonBoundariesFileNames=exonHeaderNames,
    overlapType=overlapType, overlapCutoff=overlapCutoff,
    outdir=path, verbose=TRUE)
```

## Filter probes (Perl)

If you already have an existing flat file, you might want to create a
new CDF with just a subset of the probes.  The Perl
script [selectProbes.pl](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/selectProbes.pl')%>) takes
a starting flat file and a file with the xy coordinates of the probes to
keep and returns a new flat file.

The program takes 3 arguments:

1.  the file with the original probe to probeset and unit assignments
    (ie.flat file)
2.  file with new probes to keep (x,y in column 1 and 2 respectively)
3.  outfile name

Then if I want to filter out some probes based on my own analysis of my
data, I can write these probes to a file

```r
cells <- unlist(ensb50NOvHuCells, use.names=FALSE)
probeValues <- readRawData(secLgNHuOnHu_HM, indices=cells, fields=c("xy","intensities"))
probeValues$geneId <- rep(names(ensb50NOvHuCells), times=perGeneProbeCountHu)
probeValues$Indices <- cells
write.table(probeValues[myProbes,c("x","y")], file="probeFile.txt", col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE, sep="\t")
```

Then in command line:

```sh
selectProbes.pl HuEnsembl50_nooverlap.flat probeFile.txt probeFile.flat
```

Then back to R:

```r
flat2Cdf(file=probeFile.flat, chipType="HuEx-1_0-st-v2", tags="U-Ensembl50,G-Affy,customMH,joint,80PctLowMo,80PctHighHu,EP", col.class=c("integer", "character")[c(1,1,1,2,2,2)], splitn=5)
```

Then the CDF must be moved to the correct annotationData/chipTypes/
subdirectory.



## Combine Affymetrix CLF and PGF file formats

Affymetrix sometimes provides CLF and PGF files. These are not necessary
fixed formats. CLF files (that I have) are tab-delimited, each line a
probe with three columns corresponding to 1) Probe id 2) x position 3) y
position. PGF files are not tab-delimited files, but rather nested and
give the assignment of probes to probesets.

```
#level0=probeset_id\\ttype\\tprobeset_name
  #level1=\\tatom_id\\texon_position"
  #level2=\\t\\tprobe_id\\ttype\\tgc_count\\tprobe_length\\tinterrogation_position\\tprobe_sequence"
```
For example:
```
1\\t\\tPSR150003628_x_st
  \\t1\\t130
  \\t\\t5892621\\tpm:st\\t16\\t25\\t13\\tGTCCTCCTCTACGAGGCTCTCGTCC
        
\\t2\\t155
  \\t\\t4734090\\tpm:st\\t17\\t25\\t13\\tTCCGCGTCTCTCACGCCCTCGTCCT
  \\t3\\t161
  \\t\\t3931023\\tpm:st\\t15\\t25\\t13\\tTCTCTCACGCCCTCGTCCTCTCTGA
```

The Perl script [combineProbeInfo.pl](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/combineProbeInfo.pl')%>) creates
a single tab-delimited file with each row for a probe that looks like
this after read into R. (This is the same format as the BGP).

```

```

The program takes 1 argument which is the prefix, then looks for the
files \<prefix\>.pgf and \<prefix\>.clf. It creates the file
\<prefix\>.probeflat with the per probe info and also \<prefix\>.psr
which is a tab-delimited file with each row corresponding to a probeset
in the CLF/PGF, and the columns giving the name and probeset id.

Currently there are not really checks that the PGF and the CLF contain
the same information.

Note there are no further 'unit'/gene groupings here.  The Perl
script [addGeneId.pl](<%=pathTo('/share/scripts/third-party/archive/20090212/addGeneId.pl')%>) can
take this file plus another probeset-\>Gene mapping file and add the
necessary column with that information.
