# How to: Migrate and reproduce an analysis elsewhere

Q: I've just finished a project.  How can my collaborators reproduce the
results on their machines?

A: In order to replicate an analysis, (1) the annotation data files, (2)
the raw data files, and (3) the R script need to be available.  By
transferring (1)-(3) to a new file system and rerunning the script will
reproduce the results exactly, given the same setup of packages and
version of R.  This should also be true if this is done between
different operating systems.  Here is what you need to do in order to
transfer the analysis to you collaborators:

1.  Identify and copy/zip the content of the raw data set
    directory/directories, e.g. rawData/HapMap270,CEU/Mapping250K_Nsp/
    and rawData/HapMap270,CEU/Mapping250K_Sty/.
2.  Identify and copy/zip the content of the annotation chip type
    directory/directories, e.g.
    annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping250K_Nsp/ and
    annotationData/chipTypes/Mapping250K_Sty/.  If there are auxiliary
    annotation files, you may want to copy only the ones used in the
    analysis.
3.  Identify and copy/zip all R scripts.

Note that all of the above data is available from the current working
directory (either directly or via file/directory links).  Furthermore,
the R scripts should not have to be modified, but should work "as is"
regardless of location and operating system.  This is because the
aroma.* framework is designed to work without explicit file paths (if
you find that you have to specify a path, you are probably doing
something wrong).

It is good practice to always do the above and validate the reproducible
of any analysis completed, before passing it on to collaborators or
submitting to a journal.  When doing this one often find minor
discrepancies such as not using the annotation files that one believe one
uses and so on.  It is also a good way to archive the analysis done.
