# How to: Process CEL files with mixed chip type aliases

Process CEL files with mixed chip type aliases

When Affymetrix develops a new chip type it is often sending it to a
small number of research groups labelled as an "Early Access" array.
 For instance, before the HT_HT-U133A chip type was officially released
it had been available for testing under the alias U133AAofAv2 as well as
HT_HT-U133A_EA.  Depending on what is the current alias, CEL files for
the same physical chip type may have different chip type labels in their
file headers.  Potentially this could cause issues while analyzing the
data, because the some tools are conservative and assumes that the user
has made a mistake if mixed chip type labels are detect in the same set
of CEL files.  Although <% cran('aroma.affymetrix') %> protects users for doing such
mistakes, it still allows for analyzing CEL files with mixed chip type
aliases.  There is not need to modify the CEL files.

For instance, the following setup of data set 'MyDataSet' will consider
all CEL files to be of chip type HT_HG-U133A regardless if the CEL file
headers indicates chip type HT_HG-U133A, U133AAofAv2 or
HT_HT-U133A_EA.

```r
csR <- AffymetrixCelSet$byName("MyDataSet", chipType="HT_HG-U133A")
```
