# How to: Migrating all or parts of a project to another file system

THIS DOCUMENT NEEDS A VOLUNTEER FOR:

**AUTHORING:**  

-   Briefly describe how aroma.* reads data from one directory and
    outputs in another (give one or two examples and show how the
    directories can be located).
-   rawData/: The raw data sets must be copied.  
-   annotationData/: Of course, the annotationData/ directories also
    have to be available on the new machine, e.g. via copying.  Don't
    forget about the *,monocell.CDF files; these are created
    automatically from the main *.CDF file, so it is not a problem if
    forgotten, but it take quite some time (10-60 minutes) to build them
    so it is worth copying.  
-   Show how the data directories/files can be copied, preferable using
    R (see `copyDirectory()`/`copyFile()` in <% cran('R.utils') %>).  What files to
    include (there are some files starting with a period (.), which is
    by default not listed on Unix systems using `ls` (you need `ls -a` to
    see them).
-   (Optional): By copying some o the cache files under
    \~/.Rcache/aroma.affymetrix/ one can save additional processing time
    on the destination system.

First of all, make sure to read the '[Migrate and reproduce an analysis elsewhere'](<%=pathTo('/howtos/MigrateAndReproduceAnAnalysisElsewhere/')%>) how to page
- it explains what the minimal amount data required for migrating a project.
