# Chip type: HuGene-1_0-st-v1

## Human Gene 1.0 ST Array

Affymetrix writes: "The GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array is the latest
product in the family of Affymetrix expression arrays offering
whole-transcript coverage. Each of the 28,869 genes is represented on
the array by approximately 26 probes spread across the full length of
the gene, providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene
expression than 3' based expression array designs. [...] The Gene 1.0 ST
Array uses a subset of probes from the Human Exon 1.0 ST Array and
covers only well-annotated content. Like the Exon 1.0 ST Array,
"gene-level" analysis of multiple probes on different exons is
summarized into an expression value representing all transcripts from
the same gene."

### HuGene-1_0-st-v1.r3

Note, the CDF downloaded from the Affymetrix website is in an ASCII
(text) file format.  It is highly recommended to work with binary CDFs
instead since they are orders of magnitute faster to query and more
memory efficient to work with.  Use `convertCdf()` in the
<% bioc('affxparser') %> package to convert an ASCII CDF into binary.

```r
> cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("HuGene-1_0-st-v1",
tags="r3")
