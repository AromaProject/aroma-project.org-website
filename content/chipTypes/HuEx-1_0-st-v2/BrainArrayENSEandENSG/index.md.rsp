    Contains the probe_tab file & mapping of probes to genomic
    co-ordinates for genome build GRCh37/hg19.

Notes:

-   This CDF was created by taking the common probes between v14.1 of
    the Gene (ENSG) and Exon (ENSE) annotations from
    [Brainarray](http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/brainarray/default.asp)
    (U Michigan).
-   Probes were placed into 289,999 groups based on common exon
    mappings.
-   Probes were placed into 35,202 units based on gene annotations.
-   Every probe maps uniquely to one group.
-   Every group maps uniquely to one unit.
-   Some groups contain more than 4 probes. For a visual summary see
