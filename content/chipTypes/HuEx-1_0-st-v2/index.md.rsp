## HuEx-1_0-st-v2

Affymetrix offers a by them
unsupported [CDF](http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/support/downloads/library_files/HuEx-1_0-st-v2.cdf.zip)
for the chip type HuEx-1_0-st-v2.

```r
> cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("HuEx-1_0-st-v2")
> print(cdf)
AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/ASCII
Filename: HuEx-1_0-st-v2.cdf
Filesize: 933.84MB
File format: v3 (text; ASCII)
Chip type: HuEx-1_0-st-v2
Dimension: 2560x2560
Number of cells: 6553600
Number of units: 1432154
Cells per unit: 4.58
Number of QC units: 0RAM: 0.00MB
```

This is a CDF per exon: each unit has one group/probeset, which is the
exon. There is no information about clustering exons/probesets into
genes -- see the following subpages for options for CDFs with
clusterings of exons into gene models. There are also a number of
strange probesets corresponding to control probes which can contain VERY
large numbers of probes per probeset and significantly slow down RMA
fitting.  See Thread '[Ram option is aroma
Options](http://groups.google.com/group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/ddf66c8f33b37544#)'
(Nov 8, 2007), for examples. These probesets should be removed or one of
the CDFs below which do not contain them should be used.

Note I: The CDF downloaded from the Affymetrix website is in an ASCII
(text) file format.  It is highly recommended to work with  binary CDFs
instead since they are orders of magnitute faster to query and more
memory efficient to work with.  Use convertCdf() in the affxparser
package to convert an ASCII CDF into binary.

Note II: Older CEL files for this chip type, may be reported to have
chip type 'HuEx-1_0-st-v1'.  This chip is slightly different from the
'HuEx-1_0-st-v2' chip.  According to Affymetrix support, the difference
is only in the control probes; "There is only a minor difference between
the v1 and the v2 library files and it has to do with the manufacturing
controls on the array. There is no difference with the probes
interrogating the exons between v1 and v2.", cf. Thread '[Discussion on
affymetrix-defined-transcript-clusters](http://groups.google.com/group/aroma-affymetrix/browse_thread/thread/6b3e53d3036d2515)'
(Nov 25-Dec 2, 2008).  We don't have details on the exact differences
and we don't have access to the HuEx-1_0-st.v1.CDF (please fwd if you
have it), but from Affymetrix' feedback it sounds like one could use the
new HuEx-1_0-st-v2.CDF.  In aroma.affymetrix, one can override the
default CDF by:

```r
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("HuEx-1_0-st-v2")
csR <- AffymetrixCelSet$byName("MyDataSet", cdf=cdf)
```

The following subpages contain **custom CDFs** that map the exon array
probes to gene models:

-   [Affymetrix-Defined transcript
    clusters](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/transcriptClustersCDFs')%>) are a
    'gene model' of sorts defined by clustering of exons automatically
    done by Affymetrix. The CDF contains both the transcript clusters as
    well as the exon identifications of the probes in a nested fashion.
-   [Ensembl Gene Definitions](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/Ensembl_Gene_Definitions')%>) gene models based on the Ensembl annotation.
-   [HsEx10stv2_Hs_REFSEQ](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/HuEx-1_0-st-v2/HsEx10stv2_Hs_REFSEQ')%>) give
    some notes regarding regarding custom CDFs from U Michigan that map
    the exons to RefSeq transcript identifications.

If you would like to contribute a custom-made CDF that would be great.
Please give your file descriptive tags that indicate either the date of
creation or the date of the annotation on which it is based (something
like: HuEx-1_0-st-v2,MyFavAnnot,20070525,xx.cdf where xx are you or
your institution's initials) and create a page describing how it was
made. Please do not give it a name of a pre-existing CDF available here!
Contact Elizabeth Purdom if you need assistance with contributing a CDF.
