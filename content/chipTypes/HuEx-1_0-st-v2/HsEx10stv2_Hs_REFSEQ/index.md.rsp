Notes:

-   The group from Michigan known as "Brainarray"
    (http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/) have created a number of
    "Custom CDF" files for a range of Affymetrix platforms.
-   Above is an example of the REFSEQ probe organization for the Human
    Exon platform.  Many other platforms are available for many
    organisms.
-   Note that with the 56,283 units for this chip, the first 20,789 are
    not RefSeqs.  I think they are genomic background probes, but I'm
    not sure.
-   To download one of these for your favourite chip, click on the
    "Download Custom CDF Files" link from
    http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/genomic_curated_CDF.asp
-   The file you will want is the \<chip_organism_mapping\>.cdf which is
    contained in the zip file under the column "CDF&Seq&Map&Desc".  It
    is an ASCII cdf file, so be sure to use `convertCdf()` to convert it
    to binary before using it for processing data.

<strong>CAUTION</strong>:
If you have overlapping transcripts (which RefSeq
almost surely will have), then be VERY careful if you are using the
stored probe affinities.  Because with overlapping transcripts, you
have probes that belong to multiple probesets and they will have
possibly different estimate probe effects in the different
probesets, when these get written to the 'probeAffinities.cel' file,
the indices will clash and only one probe effect will be stored.
The chip effects (i.e. gene-level expression summaries) are
unaffected by this, so if you do not need to manually access the
probe affinities, there is no worry.
