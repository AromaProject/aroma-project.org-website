This CDF has been created manually base on Ensembl gene definitions in
four steps:

1. Using [BioMart](http://www.biomart.org/), download a table of the Ensembl gene build which gives the genome coordinates of the exons.
2. Do some filtering and manipulation so that probes do not map to
   multiple genes (From the annotation available, some genes are
   perfect subsets of other genes, in terms of the probesets used, some
   genes overlap, etc. -- some judgement calls have been made).
3. Create a 2-column table giving the gene identifier and the probeset
   identifier.
4. Use `createExonByTranscriptCdf()` of <% cran('aroma.affymetrix') %> to
   create the CDF file.

```
Note that any other type of gene build exercise could be done in place
of Ensembl (Ensembl was just easy to get access to the appropriate
information).  If you have your own build, you only need to build the
file from #3 above and then create the CDF file.

If you have any questions or wish to do this for other chips, ask Mark
Robinson.

Affymetrix probesets (G-groups) can be downloaded from:
