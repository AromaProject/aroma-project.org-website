# Chip types: HT_HG-U133A & HT_HG-U133B

## HT Human Genome U133 Array Plate Set

Early access versions of the HT_HG-U133A chip type were labelled U133AAofAv2(\*) and HT_HT-U133A_EA.

Footnote: (\*) The evidence for this comes from comparing spatial images
of a CEL file with U133AAofAv2
[[PNG](<%=pathTo('assets/images/5202764005789146112904.A02,U133AAofAv2,intensities,sqrt,gray,crop400x150.png')%>)]
in the header with one with HT_HT-U133A
[[PNG](<%=pathTo('assets/images/GSM591440,HT_HG-U133A,intensities,sqrt,gray,crop400x150.png')%>)].
 Both have the same spatial patterns, i.e. blocks of checkered blocks
and control probes, "landing lights", and positive controls spelling out
'GeneChip' and 'HG-U133 AofAv2'.
