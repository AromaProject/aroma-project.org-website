# Chip type: Axiom_GW_Hu_SNP

## The Axiom Genotyping Solution

Affymetrix' press release: *Affymetrix The Axiom Genotyping Solution
Expands Content, Throughput, and Customizable Arrays on a Single
Platform*, [Oct 14, 2009](http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS122013+14-Oct-2009+BW20091014).

From the press release: "The Axiom Solution will support both
whole-genome association and candidate gene association studies with a
level of customization not currently available.  Researchers will no
longer be constrained by the content of fixed-panel arrays.  The
complete genotyping platform employs enzyme-mediated, single-base
sequencing steps for specificity in conjunction with affordable,
reproducible, and highly automated workflows. [...] With a single
platform and as few as one-and-a-half full-time technicians, a
laboratory can process more than 750 samples per week with unmatched,
minimal user intervention. The first commercial products from this
offering will support genome-wide association studies and are expected
to be delivered to customers this month."  More at

NOTE: There are no analysis methods in aroma.affymetrix that supports
this chip type.  There are several reasons for this, one is that the CEL
files the Axiom platform are so called multi-channel CEL, and none of
the preprocessing methods are prepared for this.
