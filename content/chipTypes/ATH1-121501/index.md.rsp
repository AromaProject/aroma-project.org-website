# Chip type: ATH1-121501

## Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array

"The GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array, designed in collaboration
with TIGR, contains more than 22,500 probe sets representing
approximately 24,000 genes. The array is based on information from the
international Arabidopsis sequencing project that was formally completed
in December, 2000. In parallel and subsequent to the genome's
completion, TIGR reannotated the entire genome in a project funded by
the National Science Foundation and the resulting data was used in the
design of this array. Data from the TIGR database (ATH1-121501) is
hosted in the NetAffx Analysis Center." ([Affymetrix Product

```

Note I: The CDF downloaded from the Affymetrix website is in an ASCII
(text) file format. It is highly recommended to work with binary CDFs
instead since they are orders of magnitude faster to query and more
memory efficient to work with. Use `convertCdf()` in the affxparser
package to convert an ASCII CDF into binary.
