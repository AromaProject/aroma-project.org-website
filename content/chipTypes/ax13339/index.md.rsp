# Chip type: ax13339

<% alert_help({ %>
There exists little information on this chip type, but it "appears" (see
reference below) to be the Early Access version of the 10K SNP chip.
<em>I would appreciate any further comments/references about this chip type from anyone who knows.  /Henrik 2008-07-04</em>

In Zhao X et al. (2004), the ax13339 chip type is referred to as "XbaI
mapping array 130" (p 3061), which further indicates that this is an
early version of the Mapping10K_Xba131 and the successor
Mapping10K_Xba142.

## ax13339

```r
> cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("ax13339")
> cdf
AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/ax13339
Filename: ax13339.CDF
Filesize: 8.22MB
Chip type: ax13339
RAM: 0.00MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Dimension: 712x712
Number of cells: 506944
Number of units: 10043
Cells per unit: 50.48
Number of QC units: 9
```

Comparing to the Mapping10K_Xba131 chip type, we note that they have
the same dimensions but different number of units.  This could mean that
the two chip types ax13339 and Mapping10K_Xba131 are identical, but
that the annotation has been updated.

All units are listed as 'CustomSeq' (unit type 1) units, whereas for the
10K SNP chips we should see 'Genotyping' (unit type 2) units:

```r
> unitTypes <- getUnitTypes(cdf)
> print(table(unitTypes))
unitTypes
   1
10043
```
