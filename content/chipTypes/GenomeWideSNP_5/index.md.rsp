# Chip type: GenomeWideSNP_5

## Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0

Affymetrix' press release: *Affymetrix Releases Its Most Comprehensive
Single Array for Genetic Studies*, [Feb 20,
2007](http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=AFFX&script=410&layout=-6&item_id=964780).

**Summary:**

The Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 is a PM-only chip.  *SNPs:* It
contains the exact same set of **500,568 SNPs** as was available on the
Mapping250K_{Nsp|Sty} chip set.  They have the same rsID.  The
difference is that this array and the 500K arrays use different probes
to interrogate the SNPs.  The probes on this chip type were chosen from
the ones on 500K arrays.  Allele A probes were selected and put down in
the array as technical replicates, and same for allele B probes.  There
are equal number of allele A and allele B probes, but they are may not
be with the same "shift".  That is, the A and B probes were *not*
selected in pairs.  The probes were selected according to their genotype
performance by looking how well they separated the genotype groups.
However, by "chance", approximately 350K of the SNPs turned how to have
paired A and B probes.  The other 150K SNPs have unpaired A and B
probes.  Since Affymetrix, in general, optimize the layout of probes
from their sequences etc., the unpaired probes are spatially dislocated,
whereas the paired probes are next to each other on the array.  There
are also 2748 units named "AFFX-SNP_nnnnnn"; I don't what these are.
*Copy-number non-polymorphic probes (CNPs):* In addition to the
above 500K SNPs, there are also **340,742 CN units**.  Almost all of
these are single-probe units. Their positions were chosen to "fill" in
the gaps between the SNPs.

**Two CDFs:**

Currently Affymetrix provides two different CDF files for this chip
type, one named *GenomeWideSNP_5.cdf* that contains only the SNPs, and
one named *GenomeWideSNP_5.Full.cdf* that contains the SNPs as well as
all the non-polymorphic units.

Furthermore, this is what Affymetrix writes in their 'Data Sheet:
Affymetrix: Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0' (2007): "Two alternate SNP
List (CDF) files are available. These files identify which SNPs are
available for downstream analysis. GenomeWideSNP_5.cdf is the default
set of 440,794 SNPs that are accessible via the Genotyping Console
(BRLMM-P algorithm).  GenomeWideSNP_5.Full.cdf is for advanced users
who wish to look at all SNPs from the previous-generation Mapping 500K
Array Set. This CDF file can only be accessed from the commandline tool,
snp5-probeset-genotype, which is part of the Affymetrix Power Tools
distribution. The full CDF file includes SNPs that may have lower
per-SNP accuracy or call rates. It is expected that the performance of
some of these SNPs will improve with different or future algorithms."

**...and now also an "Alternative CDF":**

"Affymetrix is providing alternative CDF files, for the Affymetrix
genotyping array- Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0. These CDF files
provide uniform access to the Copy Number probe content by presenting
"**one probe per probeset**" in both the full and default updated CDF
files. This uniform access applies to both Affymetrix genotyping arrays
with Copy Number content- Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 and
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0." /HB 2007-12-02

## GenomeWideSNP_5.Full.r2

This is the CDF file that is recommended and support in
aroma.affymetrix.  *Note, make sure to rename it such that you replace
the dots with commas.*

```r
> cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("GenomeWideSNP_5", tags="Full,r2")
> cdf

AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/GenomeWideSNP_5
Filename: GenomeWideSNP_5,Full,r2.cdf
Filesize: 249.46MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Chip type: GenomeWideSNP_5,Full,r2
Dimension: 2166x2166
Number of cells: 4691556
Number of units: 920928
Cells per unit: 5.09
Number of QC units: 6
RAM: 0.00MB
```

## BI_SNP

The early access version of this chip type was labeled BI_SNP with the
below CDF.  This means that some early CEL files might have this chip
type in the header instead of newer GenomeWideSNP_5 label.

```r
> cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("BI_SNP")
> cdf
AffymetrixCdfFile:
Path: annotationData/chipTypes/BI_SNP
Filename: BI_SNP.cdf
Filesize: 237.08MB
Chip type: BI_SNP
RAM: 0.00MB
File format: v4 (binary; XDA)
Dimension: 2166x2166
Number of cells: 4691556
Number of units: 844401
Cells per unit: 5.56
Number of QC units: 6
```

Q: *What SNPs are on the GenomeWide Human SNP v5.0 array?*

A: The SNPs on this array, are *identical* to the ones in the 500K chip
set, they are even in the same order (but using different probes and PMs
only).  In fact, the ordering are even the same in the CDFs as this
example illustrates:

```r
cdfNsp <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("Mapping250K_Nsp")
cdfSty <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("Mapping250K_Sty")
cdf50 <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("GenomeWideSNP_5",
tags="Full,r2")
un500K <- c(getUnitNames(cdfNsp), getUnitNames(cdfSty))
snps500K <- grep("\^SNP_", un500K, value=TRUE)
un50 <- getUnitNames(cdf50)
snps50 <- grep("\^SNP_", un50, value=TRUE)
print(identical(snps50, snps500K));   # Gives TRUE
```
