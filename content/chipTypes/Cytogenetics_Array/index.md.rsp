# Chip type: Cytogenetics_Array

## Cytogenetics_Array (Whole-Genome 2.7M Array; CYTO2)

From the Affymetrix press release 'New Cytogenetics Products Offer Best
Overall Approach for Detection of Chromosome Aberrations' ([March 25,
2009](http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090325005265&newsLang=en)):
"The [two] Affymetrix Cytogenetics (i) Whole-Genome 2.7M Array and (ii)
Cytogenetics Focused Array include copy number (CN) and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) content to identify loss of heterozygosity
(LOH), uniparental disomy (UPD), and regions identical-by-descent. [...]
The (i) Whole-Genome 2.7M Array [...] provides 2.7 million markers,
including 400,000 SNPs, to offer superior resolution and enable
detection of even the smallest structural changes and regions of
autozygosity. The (ii) Focused Array includes more than 330,000 markers
to enable efficient detection of aberrations within focused regions of
known cytogenetic importance. At the same time, it maintains a backbone
of markers at 16 kb spacing to provide whole-genome coverage."

There are 400,103 SNPs and 2,394,920 CN units in this CDF.  267,197 SNPs
have only one probe pair, 104,264 SNPs have two probe pairs and 10,786
have three.  There are also a small number of SNPs with more probe
pairs.  2,377,527 of the CN units are single CN probes (as in GWS5 and
GWS6).  In addition to this, there are 1,775 CN units with two probes,
5,618 with 3 probes, 1,496 with 7 probes, and 8,504 with 8 probes.

-   To the best of my understanding, the assay does not use restriction
    enzymes.  Hence, no fragment-length annotation files.
-   This chip types has probe sequences of variable lengths in the range
    of 38 to 50-mers.  The aroma.affymetrix package does not support
    variable length probe sequences at this stage.
