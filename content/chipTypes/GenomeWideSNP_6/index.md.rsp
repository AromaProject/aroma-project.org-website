# Chip type: GenomeWideSNP_6

## Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0

Affymetrix' press release: *Affymetrix Sets New Standard in Genotyping
With Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0*, [May 21,
2007](http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=AFFX&script=410&layout=-6&item_id=1004567).

From the press release: "The Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 contains more than
900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and more than 946,000
non-polymorphic probes for the detection of copy number variation.
[...]".

The design of the 6.0 is better than 5.0.  For instance, for SNPs the
allele A and allele B probes where not necessarily aligned in target
sequence on the 5.0 chip, but is (again) on the 6.0 chip.

The Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array interrogates 934,946 SNPs and 946,371 CNPs
totalling 1,878,317 loci.

Enzymes Nsp and Sty are used in parallel in the assay and the amplified
targets are mixed together at the very end.  For this reason, some of
the probes on the array are targeting sequences that may sit on
fragments cut by either enzymes or both.  According to Jim Veitch
(Affymetrix, 2007-10-22): the SNP probes occur in a Nsp, Sty or Nsp+Sty
fragment, but the CN probes occur only Nsp and Nsp+Sty fragments (not
Sty-alone fragments).

The Broad Institute has a Research News article '[A unique collaboration
between Cambridge and Silicon
Valley](http://www.broad.mit.edu/news/1059)' (Sept 7, 2008), which gives
some background on how the GenomeWideSNP_5 and GenomeWideSNP_6 chip
types were developed as part of a collaboration between Affymetrix and
the Broad Institute.

Early versions of this chip type are GenomeWideEx_6 and
GenomeWideEx_6_v2.
