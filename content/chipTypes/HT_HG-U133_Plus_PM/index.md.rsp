# Chip type: HT_HG-U133_Plus_PM

## HT HG-U133+ PM Array Plate

Affymetrix press release: ??? (2008?)

Affymetrix product page: "Measure gene expression of more than 47,000
transcripts and variants, including more than 33,000 well-characterized
genes and UniGene clusters per sample." [...] "Two design changes were
introduced with the GeneChip HT HG-U133+ PM Array Plate: (1) Only
perfect match (PM) probes from the cartridge design were retained while
mismatch (MM) probes were removed. (2) Empirical data was used to select
the best-performing probes resulting in reducing the number of PM
probes; (i) 42,461 probe sets were reduced from 11 to nine probes (ii)
Six probe sets were reduced from 11 to 10."
