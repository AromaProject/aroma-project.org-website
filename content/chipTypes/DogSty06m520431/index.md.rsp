# Chip type: DogSty06m520431

The DogSty06m520431 chip type is the 2nd version of a custom Canine SNP
array.

From Broad's [Canine SNP
FAQ](http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/dog/caninearrayfaq.html)
(2008-07-21): "The version 2 array (part number 520431) is a 5 um,
100-format, PM probe only (20 probes/SNP) WGSA design, which can detect
a total of 127K SNPs. These SNPs were chosen from the 2.5 million SNP
map generated as part of the dog genome project and include the majority
of the v1 platinum set SNPs. A "v2 platinum" set of 49,663 SNPs was
selected to include accurate and robust SNPs, using a panel of \>10
diverse breeds. The library file (DogSNPs520431P) has masked out the
SNPs that are not of high quality and thus only will show results for
the "v2 platinum" SNPs. Also available is the library file for all
SNPs.".

*Important for aroma.affymetrix users*: The two CDFs available from
Broad are named DogSty06m520431.cdf and DogSty06m520431P.cdf where the
'P' indicates 'Platinum'.  Since both CDFs refer to the same (physical)
chip type, it is more convenient to put the in the same
annotationData/chipType/DogSty06m520431/ directory.  For
aroma.affymetrix to be able to locate the Platinum CDF, **rename
DogSty06m520431P.cdf to DogSty06m520431,Platinum.cdf**.

### How the UGP files were created

```r
library("aroma.affymetrix")

# Choose the CDF to create an UGP file for
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("DogSty06m520431", tags="Platinum")
cdf <- AffymetrixCdfFile$byChipType("DogSty06m520431")

# Allocate empty UGP file
ugp <- AromaUgpFile$allocateFromCdf(cdf, tags="Broad20080721,HB20080721")

# Read genome location data from external text file
tab <- TabularTextFile("AffyV2_all_probeset.txt", path=getPath(cdf))
colClassPatterns <- c(ProbeId="character", Chr="character", Pos="integer")
df <- readDataFrame(tab, colClassPatterns=colClassPatterns)

# Coerce chromosome labels to integers
df$Chr[df$Chr == "X"] <- "39" # Turn ChrX into Chr39.
df$Chr <- as.integer(df$Chr)

# Write data to UGP file
units <- indexOf(cdf, names=df$ProbeId)

# Store only units existing in the CDF
keep <- !is.na(units)
ugp[units[keep],1] <- df$Chr[keep]
ugp[units[keep],2] <- df$Pos[keep]

# Update UGP file footer
footer <- readFooter(ugp)
footer$createdBy <- list(fullname="Henrik Bengtsson")
footer$srcFile <- list(
  filename=getFilename(tab),
  filesize=getFileSize(tab),
  checksum=getChecksum(tab)
)
writeFooter(ugp, footer)
```
