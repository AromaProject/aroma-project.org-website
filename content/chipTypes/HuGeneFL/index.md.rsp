# Chip type: HuGeneFL (a.k.a. Hu6800)

## HuGeneFL (a.k.a. Hu6800)

"The Affymetrix GeneChip HuGeneFL Array is a single array that enables
the relative monitoring of mRNA transcripts ofapproximately 5,600
full-length human genes. The full-length genes were selected from three
databases: exemplars from UniGene Build 18 supplemented with additional
genes from GenBank and TIGR. This array was initially released
byAffymetrix in November of 1998." [Affymetrix, GeneChip Made-to-Order
Program, Part No. 701159  Rev 2, 2001]

This chip type is also known as: Hu6800
(<http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cli/complab/dchip/info_file.htm>) and
HG-U6800.
