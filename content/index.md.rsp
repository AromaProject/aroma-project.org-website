Aroma.affymetrix is an R package for analyzing small to extremely large
Affymetrix data sets.  It allows you to analyze any number of arrays of
various chip types, e.g. 10,000s of expression arrays, SNP chips, exon
arrays and so on.  Here are some of the features:

-   Number of arrays: **unlimited**.
-   System requirements: As low as **1GB RAM, any operating system**.
-   Chip types: **all Affymetrix** [chip types](<%=pathTo('/chipTypes/')%>) with a CDF,
    e.g. gene expression, exon, SNP & CN, tiling arrays.
-   Immediate support for **custom CDFs**,
    e.g. [BrainArray](http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF/genomic_curated_CDF.asp), [GeneAnnot](http://www.xlab.unimo.it/GA_CDF/) and
    [Wageningen
    University-NuGO](http://nmg-r.bioinformatics.nl/NuGO_R.html).
-   File formats: Works directly with **CEL and CDF files** (all
    versions; text/ASCII, binary/XDA, binary/Calvin).
-   Export to/Import from: Bioconductor, CNAG, CNAT & dChip.
-   Pre-processing: Background correction, allelic cross-talk
    calibration, quantile normalization, nucleotide-position
    normalization etc.
-   Probe-level modeling: RMA (log-additive), MBEI (multiplicative),
    affine (multiplicative with or without offset), ACNE (non-negative
    matrix factorization).
-   Post-processing: PCR fragment-length and/or GC-content
    normalization.
-   Paired & non-paired copy-number analysis: All generations, including
    10K, 100K, 500K, 5.0, 6.0, and CytoScanHD. Estimation of
    full-resolution (raw) copy numbers using CRMA (10K-500K) and CRMAv2
    (10K-CytoScanHD). Combine data from multiple chip types.
    Segmentation methods such as CBS, GLAD and HaarSeg.
-   Genotyping: CRLMM (100K & 500K).
-   Alternative splicing: FIRMA.
-   **Dynamic HTML reports**: [ArrayExplorer &
    ChromosomeExplorer](<%=pathTo('/demos/')%>).
-   **Persistent memory**: Final and intermediate results and estimates
    are stored on the file system.
-   **Robustness**: Analysis picks up where last interrupted.  Only
    complete files are produced (even during power failures).
-   Reproducibility: Near **perfect replication** of RMA, GCRMA and
    SNPRMA (normalization & summarization) as implemented in the
    affyPLM, affy, gcrma and oligo packages, as well as CRLMM
    (genotyping) of oligo.
-   **Portable scripts**: All data sets and data files are referred to
    by their names - not by pathnames.
-   Design goals: usability, quality & extendibility.
