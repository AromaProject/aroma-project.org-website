# Reproducible research

Being able to reproduce scientific results is extremely important.  We
make great efforts having the analysis methods in the aroma suite
produce the exact same results over generations of updates.  For
instance, for each release we run a large set of redundancy tests to
assert the correctness of results and that methods are backward
compatible.

## Extensive testing

Before each new release, we run a large number of system and redundancy
tests on real data to validate that the new code is backward compatible
and does not break existing functionality.  The tests cover a large
number of chip types and statistical methods.  The complete set of tests
is available in the following directory:

```r
  path <- system.file("testScripts", package="aroma.affymetrix")
```



## Reproducibility of existing implementations

In addition to this, most of the standard methods reproduce the results
of the original methods/implementations, e.g. RMA.  Here is a list of
documents showing how well we can reproduce existing methods:

-   [RMA (background, normalization & summarization)](<%=pathTo('/replication/RMA')%>)
-   [gcRMA (background, normalization &
    summarization)](<%=pathTo('/replication/gcRMA')%>)
-   [RmaPlm() and affyPLM's log-additive
    summarization](<%=pathTo('/replication/RmaPlm_and_affyPLM')%>)
-   [Reproducing SNPRMA in the oligo package](<%=pathTo('/replication/SNPRMA')%>)
-   [CRLMM genotyping (100K and 500K)](<%=pathTo('/vignettes/CRLMM100K500K')%>)
