**Update 2010-03-20: The problem reported here has been solved in mpcbs v1.1.1.**



## Failed MPCBS segmentation

I have identified a problem with the current implementation of MPCBS
that causes it to miss some obvious segments.  I am simulating data and
compare with the results of CBS (`DNAcopy::segment()`), GLAD
(`GLAD::glad()`), and HaarSeg (`HaarSeg::haarSeg()`).  Since the error terms
are drawn randomly (without a fixed seed), the issue with MPCBS does not
occur every time.  Indeed, it only occurs every 10-20 times.  However,
with 24 chromosomes and hundreds of samples, this becomes a real issue.

_Figure: Simulated log2 CNs (gray) segmented by CBS (red), GLAD (blue),
HaarSeg (orange) and MPCBS (purple).  500kb smoothed CNs (black) are
also shown.  The true CN segmentation is the same across runs, but the
noise is randomly drawn.  For this particular run, MPCBS failed to
identify the last change point.  There are J=1000 data points._

## Setup

In R v2.10.0 or newer, do:

```r
source("http://aroma-project.org/hbLite.R")

# Install aroma.affymetrix and friends
hbInstall("aroma.affymetrix")

# Install developers aroma.core v1.5.1 (*) 
installPackages("http://www.braju.com/R/repos/aroma.core_1.5.1.tar.gz")

# Install mpcbs v1.1.0 (*)
installPackages("http://www.braju.com/R/repos/mpcbs_1.1.0.tar.gz")

# Install DNAcopy
biocLite("DNAcopy")
```

Footnote:  
(\*) Windows users: To install on Windows, replace \*.tar.gz with \*.zip.  
(\*) OS X users: To install on OS X, add argument `type="source"`, e.g. `installPackages("http://www.braju.com/R/repos/aroma.core_1.5.1.tar.gz",
type="source")`


## Notes

In <% cran('aroma.core') > I provide `segmentByCBS()`, `segmentByGLAD()`,
`segmentByHaarSeg()` and `segmentByMPCBS()` that are standardized wrappers
calling the corresponding segmentation method.  This means that the
results will be identical to what you would get if you called the
individual packages directly.  No parameter settings are changed.  Note
that if the underlying segmentation package/function is updated, this
will directly reflect the results of the `segmentByNnn()` methods.


## Script

The R script that simulates CNs and runs the different segmentation
methods can be downloaded/seen here:

<https://r-forge.r-project.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/pkg/aroma.core/incl/RawGenomicSignals.SEG.Rex?rev=1922&root=aroma-dots>

You can even run this directly from R as:

```r
library("aroma.core")
source("https://r-forge.r-project.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/pkg/aroma.core/incl/RawGenomicSignals.SEG.Rex?rev=1922&root=aroma-dots")
```

and you should get a plot similar to the above.

The simulated data that generates the above data and plot can be loaded
as:

```
library("aroma.core")
load(url("https://www.aroma-project.org//xfer/MPCBS/mpcbs,bug.RData"))
```
