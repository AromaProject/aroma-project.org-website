# Tools for processing Affymetrix data

## ABSOLUTE & HAPSEG

Authors: Scott Carter et al. (Broad Institute)  
What: "When DNA is extracted from an admixed population of cancer and
normal cells, the information on absolute copy number per cancer cell is
lost in the mixing.  The purpose of ABSOLUTE is to re-extract these data
from the mixed DNA population.  This process begins by generation of
segmented copy number data, which is input to the ABSOLUTE algorithm
together with pre-computed models of recurrent cancer karyotypes and,
optionally, allelic fraction values for somatic point mutations.  The
output of ABSOLUTE then provides re-extracted information on the
absolute cellular copy number of local DNA segments and, for point
mutations, the number of mutated alleles."

with a biological observation made from a gene expression experiment.
EXALT has extracted signatures of differential genes within each
experiment and built a large formatted collection of microarray
results from NCBI GEO and published cancer studies. Thus, investigators
can focus on discovery by searching, browsing, and querying on
pre-computed gene expression signatures."

## Affymetrix CDF File Conversion Tool

Author: Affymetrix Inc.  
 What: The chip definition file (CDF) File Conversion Tool will convert
all Affymetrix CDF files (GCOS library files) in a specified directory
from its current ASCII format to a new binary format that will be used
in future versions of the GCOS software. DO NOT use this tool to convert
library files managed by the GCOS 1.1 or below software as that software
does not understand the new binary format.

## MS-DOS subst

What: The [Windows/MS-DOS] console
'[subst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subst)' utility makes a drive
letter to any Windows directory, e.g. subst Y: 'C:/Documents and
Settings/JohnDoe/Documents/My
Research/Projects/aroma.affymetrix/ProjectA/'.  This provides a
workaround when a pathname becomes too long for Windows.  The maximum
number of symbols in a pathname is 256, including file separators '/' or
'\\', but excluding the drive letter, and initial file separator (e.g.
"C:/"), and the string terminator ('\\0'), cf. [MSDN - Naming a File or
Directory](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247.aspx).  In R
v2.8.x, the limit is one symbol less, i.e. 255.
