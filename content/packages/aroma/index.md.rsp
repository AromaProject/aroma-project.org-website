# Package aroma (2001-): Preprocessing of spotted microarray data

## aroma - Preprocessing of spotted microarray data

Developed since: 2001-03-10

### Description

The aroma ("An R Object-oriented Microarray Analysis package") package
was first developed in March 2001 as an extension to the
<% cran('sma') %> ("Statistical Microarray Analysis") package
(Yee Hwa Yang et al.).

<% alert_warn({ %>
<strong>NOTE</strong>:
Despite its name, this package is independent of the other
packages in the Aroma Project framework.  This page was added to the
Aroma Project website for the convenience of the users and developers
who are using this package.
<% }) %>

<% alert_warn({ %>
<strong>NOTE</strong>:
The development of this package has stopped. It is only kept to
a minimum such that it still installs.  For two-color microarrary
analysis, I recommend to use the <a ref="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">limma</a> package available on Bioconductor.
<% }) %>



### Installation

In order to install the aroma package and all its dependencies
(including the sma package), in a fresh R session do:

```r
source("http://aroma-project.org/hbLite.R")
hbInstall("aroma")
```

You may see some warnings, especially while installing the sma package,
but you should *not* see/get any errors.

COMMENT: The sma package has been deprecated by its maintainer(s) and is
(as of Feb 2011) only available via the [CRAN
archives](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/sma/).  The last
available version (sma v0.5.15) will no longer install on recent R
version.  For this reason, we have "patched" sma to v0.5.16 (not on
CRAN; only on the servers of the Aroma Project) by doing minimal fixes
such that it installs.

### Usage

Afterward installation, load the aroma and the sma packages by:

```r
> library("aroma")

To further assert that the packages were successfully installed, try one
of the examples, e.g.

```r
> example(GenePixData)
```

This should load some example data and generate a log-ratio
log-intensity scatter plot.
