## Memoization - automatic caching of computational expensive tasks

There are several computations in aroma.affymetrix that generate
identical output and are repeated between method calls or even
analysis sessions.  In order to speed up such repeated calculations,
the package caches results using a technique referred to as
[memoization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).  You will
typically notice that the first time you analyze a new type of chip,
some computations takes a long time, but the second time it is much
faster.
 
For instance, in some cases the index of the _first cell_ (but not the
others) in each CDF unit is queried.  In order to retrieve these
indices, first all indices for all units are read and then the first
index is extracted from each unit.  Since there are several 100,000s
of units, this is a time consuming process.  In order to not have to
repeat this process each time this kind of data is needed, the package
caches the result to the file system the first time, and then reloads
the cached results in future calls.  This mechanism is referred to as
_on-file caching_.
 
In cases where the computational expensive results are small enough,
the package sometimes cache the results in memory for quick lookup.
This is mainly used to speed up interactive usage, that is, method
calls by the user at the prompt.  This mechanism is referred to as
_in-memory caching_. 
 
It is only redundant data that is cached, that is, cached (on-file or
in-memory) results may be deleted at anytime without harm.

## File caching
Results cached to file are stored by default in the so call _cache
root path_:
```
~/.Rcache/
```
You can find the current path by calling `getCacheRootPath()`. The
location of the `.Rcache/` directory can be modified by using
`setCacheRootPath()`. For example:
```
setCacheRootPath("/tmp/.Rcache/")
```
See `help("Startup")` how to add this to the `.Rprofile` file in order
for this to be applied to all R sessions started.  Alternatively, one
can set the path using system environment variable `R_CACHE_PATH`.
The former overrides the latter.
 
Cache files are named `<32-chars hexadecimal>.Rcache` where the
hexadecimal part is a unique (MD5) identifier,
e.g. `5c01b589b209fe250a04cda2d297555c.Rcache`.  Since the filename
itself does not reveal what kind of data is cached, the cache
directory structure is setup such that it should be possible to
identify at least what type of results are contained in the cached
files. First of all, all data cached by the package is stored under:
```
<cache root path>/aroma.affymetrix/
```
Then, for instance, data specific to a certain chip type is cached to:
```
<cache root path>/aroma.affymetrix/<chip type>/
```
and data specific to a certain data set is cached to:
```
<cache root path>/aroma.affymetrix/<data set name>,<data set tags>/
```
With this structure it is easy to clean out the cached data for a
certain project when done.
