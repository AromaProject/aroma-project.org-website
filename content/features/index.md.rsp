CHIP TYPES/DATA FILES:  
* Number of arrays: unlimited.  
 * Chip types: all Affymetrix chip types with a CDF, e.g. SNP, exon,
and gene expression.  
 * Immediate support for custom CDFs, e.g. Brainarray and AffyProbeMiner.  
* File formats: Works directly with CEL and CDF files (all versions;
text/ASCII, binary/XDA, binary/Calvin).

LOW-LEVEL ANALYSIS:  
* Pre-processing: Background correction, allelic cross-talk
calibration, quantile normalization etc.  
* Probe-level modeling: RMA (log-additive), MBEI (multiplicative),
affine (multiplicative with or without offset).  
* Post-processing: PCR fragment-length normalization.

IMPORT/EXPORT:  
* Export to/Import from: Bioconductor, CNAG, CNAT & dChip.

REPORTS:  
* Dynamic HTML reports: ArrayExplorer (HapMap demo), ChromosomeExplorer
(HapMap demo, Tumor/Normal demo).  Requires Firefox.

DOCUMENTATION/HELP:  
* Documentation: Online documentation is collected under Pages.  
* Vignettes: Online example code is collected in Section Vignettes.

DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION:  
* Bounded-memory algorithms.  
 * Low memory requirements: Minimum 500MB RAM (recommended \>1GB RAM)  
* Persistent data and result storage: Final and intermediate results
and estimates are stored on file.  
 * Robustness: Analysis picks up where last interrupted.  
 * Portable scripts: All data files are referred to by relative
pathnames.  
* Cross platform: Work with any operating system.  
* Design goals: usability, quality & extendibility.



COPY-NUMBER ANALYSIS:  
* Paired & non-paired copy-number analysis: All generations, i.e. 10K,
100K, 500K, 5.0 & 6.0. CBS & GLAD * segmentation methods.  Combine data
from multiple chip types.

EXON ARRAY ANALYSIS:  
* Alternative splicing: FIRMA.

EXPRESSION AND MORE:  
* Most Affymetrix chip types are supported.
