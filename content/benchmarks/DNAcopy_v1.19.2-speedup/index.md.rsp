There was a significant speedup implemented in <% bioc('DNAcopy') %> v1.19.2 (June 2009).   For example, in a high-density data set, where Chr 1 has
roughly 450K loci, processing Chr 1 alone using weighted CBS took ~20 mins before (DNAcopy v1.18.0) whereas it takes ~30s now (DNAcopy v1.19.2) - that is a 40 times speed up.

I ran some simple benchmarking where I simulated the same CN
profile with a density of J=10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 2\*10^5, 5\*10^5, 10^6 loci.
I compared the previous algorithm in DNAcopy v1.18.0 (==v1.19.0) with
the new in DNAcopy v1.19.2, and it appears that the DNAcopy update made
the algorithm to go from something like O(J*log(J)) to near O(J).
Moreover, the weighted version (where one use locus-specific weights)
is now almost as fast as the non-weighted one.
