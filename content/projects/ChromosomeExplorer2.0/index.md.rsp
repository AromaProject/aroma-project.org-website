A ChromosomeExplorer report allows you to browse and navigate genomic
data across samples, chromosomes and regions.  It is viewed via a web
browser, either online or locally, and is written in HTML, CSS,
Javascript and displays PNG images.  For examples, see [Demos](<%=pathTo('/demos/')%>).

## Proposed project

Update or rewrite the ChromosomeExplorer such that:

-   It can display layers of images, e.g. one layer showing cytobands
    and one showing CBS segmentation tracks on top of a layer showing
    the full resolution data.  Other layers may be smoothed data,
    alternative segmentation methods, highlights of regions of interest
    and so.
-   It works with "tiled" images, as for instance Google Maps does.
     This will allow greater zoom levels, because browsers cannot
    display too large images.  It will also speed up online viewing as
    less data needs to be transferred.
-   In addition to Firefox, it should also works with Google Chrome and
    Internet Explorer and other common web browsers.

## Requirements

-   It must be super-simple to install even for beginners.
-   As today, the ChromosomeExplorer must use standard HTML, CSS and
    Javascript code.
-   As today, the ChromosomeExplorer must work on all OSes that R
    supports, especially Linux, OS X, and Windows.
-   As today, the ChromosomeExplorer report must be functional also via
    the file:// protocol, that is, viewable on a local file system
    without utilizing a web server.  If not all features, at least the
    basic features should be supported.  If there is a cross-platform
    and light-weight web server that is easy to install in R, that may
    also be used.
-   As today, it should be possible to make the ChromosomeExplorer
    report available online via simply copy the report directory to a
    web server.
-   As today, all code must be released as open source under a license
    making it freely available to at least the academic community.

## Things that may be useful



-   The new light-weight web server that is built-in in R from R
    v2.10.0.  Can we hook on to this one?
-   The Tcl-based web server available in R.rsp ["The Tcl server was
    written by Steve Uhlers, and later adopted for R by Philippe
    Grosjean and Tom Short (Rpad package)"].
-   As of today, part of the HTML and Javascript are generated using RSP
    (<% cran('R.rsp') %> package), which is very similar to what the brew package is
    doing.
-   How far can we use Javascript packages such as jQuery, Prototype
    etc?  Will any of these work without a web server (over the file://
    protocol)?
-   What can we borrow from projects such as the <% cran('lme4') %> and the
    <% cran('ggplot2') %> web applications, cf.
